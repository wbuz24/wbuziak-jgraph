I note the "group" here of students -- for example, Group C is 202 in Fall,
2021, 302 in Spring, 2022, and 494 in Fall, 2022. Group B is composed of the
360 students in spring 2022, who eventually became group C students by taking
494 in Fall, 2022).

There will be some Group C students who take 360 in spring, 2023. If I have it
in me, I'll write new material for them, but we'll see..... There will be
a Group E crop that starts CS202 in spring, 2023.

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 (will have some Group C's in there).
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023, 302 Fall, 2023, 360/494 Spring, 2024

Today's music of the day features the Italian computer Domenico Scarlatt. Scarlatti wrote a bazillion sonatas, which he meant for both practice and performacne.  Each one is typically 5 minutes long, and they make for good background music while you're working.  This performance of a sonata in C, by Soviet pianist Emil Gilels, from the 1950's, is one of the most ebullient performances of any piece of music that you'll hear, which is why I start with it.  In fact, this may be one of the best piano performance you'll hear of any piece of music -- simply joyful.  It makes me happy every time it comes up on the random play.

Do you want a point of comparison?  Compare it to that of another famous pianist of the time, Aruturo Michelangeli -- this is ponderous compared to Gilels, isn't it?  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jy92VKaaarE

Not to trash Michelangeli -- he slays this Scarlatti sonata (in Bm):  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FiZc7kbrWw

Here are a few more favorite Scarlatti performances.  Michael Lewin is a model of clarity and drive in this performance of this sonata in E.  When I first heard it, I googled Lewin and emailed him to let him know how much I liked it (He's a professor at the Boston Conservatory of Music) -- like Emil Gilels, I try to share the joy every now and then: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWp8TCgyHnk

You get to see Martha Argerich's super-fast hands in this classic performance of a sonata in Dm: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Uq3Jiz0y50

And we finish with Vladimir Horowitz in a pretty nice recording for 1946: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqLxsUetCzw

Music of the Day: This song by the group "Yes" just hit my
random-play, and I figure it's worth a share.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mlA05RGEkMs -- it was written in 1978, part of the album "Tormato", which
has about the worst album cover you can imagine.  You've probably
heard of Yes, which was one of the leading proponents of "progressive
rock" in the 1970's (and beyond), featuring complex arrangements and
dense lyrics in falsetto.  By and large, the lyrics to most Yes songs
are ludicrous, and I don't pay them any attention.  On the flip side,
I think that the music itself is great.  This song is relatively
unknown, perhaps because of the bad album, and perhaps because of the
inane lyrics.  It's a great study in rhythm though -- the opening
lines have the bass and drums playing in six, while the guitar plays
in eight, until they sync up (00:18).
They then move into a
section in 13 (alternating 6 and 7's: 00:18 to 00:33) before a brief respite in 4
(00:33 to 00:42)
and then into 14 when the vocals start (00:42).  I'll let you figure out the
rest -- Fun stuff if you like to pay attention to it...

Further exploration: Yes' best albums are 50 years old, from 1971 and 1972: The Yes Album (
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDYh635cJ1E ), Close to the Edge ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GNkWac-Nm0A 
) and Fragile ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hE7HZCVVRU )).  Good stuff.

Music of the day -- the scherzo from Ravel's String Quartet.  Although I love classical music, I'm pretty tepid on string quartets -- typically music that gets you daydreaming and thinking about other things, and waiting for it to be over.  However, Ravel's only string quartet, written in 1903 when he was 28, is a breath of fresh air, and I've found that people who don't like classical music like this movement because it's lively and fun.  I'll give you four youtube links -- decide for yourself. 
#1 is my favorite from a scratchy old vinyl record made in 1964, by the Stuyvesant Quartet: 
https://youtu.be/THiXCAJ69cE?t=460 

#2 is the one I've had recommended most, recorded by the Quartetto Italiano in 1967 -- more virtuosic but a little less bounce to me: 
https://youtu.be/OLlN87PpywA?t=513 

#3: The Hagen quartet gives a nice performance and you actually get to see video.  String quartet musicians are fun to watch because they always make weird faces and gestures -- why not: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhN0RRlLhDg 

#4: The American Quartet gives a nice reading, too, in this video:

Group C: 2022-02-03: CS302

Music of the day -- I've been fortunate enough to see a few Jazz greats in various places: Dizzie Gillespie came to New Haven when I was in college (let's say, 1986 maybe) and gave a free concert in Woolsey Hall, wearing a stylish purple leather suit.  That's a good memory.  Another good memory is when my friend Bruce turned me onto Gillespie's big band number, "Manteca" -- Cuban rhythms, bepop trumpet , full band blaring - worth a listen when you have a few minutes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V_ff9Y9aWw 

Here's a nice video of Manteca live by the "Kenny Clarke Francy Brolund Big Band" with Gillespie as a soloist.  Oddity -- the band has two drummers: Kenny Clarke and Kenny Clare.  Go figure.  There's a good moment at 3:17 where you can see both Kenny's flailing away together!  That would have been a fun concert, I think, but I'm afraid the audience looks like they might be a little bored....  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5tRGMHfKrE

Group A: 2021-02-04: CS360: Rachmaninoff
Group B: 2022-02-10: CS360: Rachmaninoff
Group C: 2022-02-10: CS302: Rachmaninoff

Today's MOTD focuses a on the Russian composer/pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff.  You can't make a list of "greatest pianists who have ever recorded" without including Rachmaninoff.  His playing was stunning -- fast, clear, often with very little blurring pedal, and quite rhythmic.  He was far more passionate about composing than performing, but when he emigrated to the United States because of the Russian Revolution (being from an aristocratic family was not a plus then), he had to make a living, and that came from performing.  I like this quote -- when asked who were the greatest living pianists at the time, his response was typically laconic: "Well, there's (Josef) Hoffman.  And there's me."

Little-known fact: Rachmaninoff's last concert was in Alumni Gym here in Knoxville in 1943.  This was before renovations, when it looked and sounded like a high school gym, and I'm sure every note echoed about 50 times...  There's a plaque on the outside of Alumni memorializing the event, as well as a giant statue of Rachmaninoff in the World's Fair Park.  I went to the 50th anniversary of the concert (1993 - duh), which was held in Alumni (before the renovation), and one of the cool things is that there were about 10 people in the audience who had been to the original concert 50 years earlier!

Rachmaninoff's 2nd and 3rd piano concertos are top-five in the repertoire, but I'll give you some smaller solo pieces that are lesser known, and beautifully atmospheric.  First, is a prelude -- he wrote 24 of these, one of which (C#m) made him famous when he emigrated to the US.  I like this one better, Opus 32, #2 -- lush and beautiful --  performed by Sviatoslav Richter:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVTuWnGMxMk 

Second is the first piece from his "Moments Musicaux", Opus 16 -- performed by Lazar Berman -- moody moody moody.  Back in the days before random-play, I had all my music on cassette tapes, and I knew when I pulled this out that I was likely in a wistful, maybe even down mood.  I really like this piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o23lRJTtFpA 

He wrote two sets of "Etudes-Tableaux", which are both difficult and colorful.   Like the preludes, they are worth getting to know well.  This one (Opus 33, #9) is one of my favorites, because it is loud, proud, brief, impetuous, and completely bad-ass.  Nikolai Lugansky rips it to shreds in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXREb5OPRrA

Last is a piece I probably wouldn't listed to twice, except Rachmaninoff recorded it a bunch of times -- clearly he likes it, and if you dredge them up, he changes the music in all of them.  This is his Serenade, Opus 3 #5.  It's a nice melody played with accompaniment above and below, followed by lilting chords and some nasty runs -- Rachmaninoff really puts personality into the recording:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfFIEHv4JOY 

To compare -- this dude does an excellent job with the piece, but listen to it, and then to Rachmaninoff -- hopefully you'll hear the magic of Rachmaninoff's playing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cem_HFwDqyA

Group A: 2021-02-09: CS360: Won't get fooled again
Group D: 2023-02-02
Group E: 2023-02-02

Just on my random play is a "classic" song that you probably already know, but if you don't, take a listen.  It's the song "Won't Get Fooled Again,' by the British band The Who from the album "Who's Next" in 1971.  The song features everything you'd want: great instrumental work, powerful lyrics, a quintessential scream.  Sure, it's 7+ minutes, but time flies:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHhrZgojY1Q 

Labelle's cover of the song in 1973 has a completely different vibe, but it works great.  (Around the time of "Who's Next", Labelle was an opening act for the Who, which is why I'm guessing they decided to cover the song).  The Who's bassist, John Entwistle was one of the greatest bassists of all time, but I think that the great Chuck Rainey, who was on this album for Labelle, simply steals the show.  Pay attention to the bass:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXdj6zGmfdM 

I saw The Who perform this live at JFK stadium in Philadelphia in 1982 -- The original drummer, Keith Moon, was dead by this point, but The Who still knew how to command an audience of 100,000, and the visual is still with me nearly 40 years later...  The lineup that day consisted of:

- The Hooters, a band from Philadelphia, had a hit or two back then, so they made a good leadoff.  I always liked the song "Birdman" even though it was not even remotely a hit:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S7ynbv45OqI 

- Their biggest hit was "All You Zombies."  Here's a really dated video.  I like "Birdman" better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LE0KpcP05I

- Santana, which should have been the undercard rather than the #2.  To hear what Santana could do live, check out the sequence Carnaval / Let the Children Play / Jugando from 1976.  Oh my -- this fires me up every time I hear it, and I think I've heard it 100 times:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp1g_gnN3iM 

- The Clash, which at the point had a hit with the moronic song "Should I Stay or Should I Go" - Yuck:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN1WwnEDWAM 

- And of course, The Who. Here's a video of them doing "Won't Get Fooled Again" live. They were basically four lead musicians (who often didn't like each other) vying for attention.   This video captures the essence of a Who show quite well.  You don't see a keyboardist because that keyboard line is on tape, just like on the album.  There's a great quote in the video comments: "Listening to The Who is like watching a drunken elephant stagger from one side of a china shop to the other, without breaking a single dish somehow.  Reckless, dangerous, chaotic, perfect.  Everybody is playing lead breaks at the same time, but it works somehow.  That's The Who."

Group A: 2021-02-11: CS360: Prokofiev
Group B: 2022-05-03: CS360: Prokofiev

I don't have time to get too chatty, so let's have some recordings of the greatest composer of the 20th century, Sergei Prokofiev.  His jam was mixing wonderful and catchy melodies with discordant harmonies and aggressive percussiveness, typically on the piano.  Here are three great recordings that you should also find accessible.  First, his Toccata played by Gyorgy Sandor is really manic, but still accessible:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuY8eoe_iLA 

Second is his 2nd piano concerto, which blends all three features above with a 5-minute piano solo toward the end which is over-the-top violent.  Great recording by John Browning 50 years ago:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1JYRm8ACkc 
-- The link is just the 1st movement -- I'm sure youtube will queue the other three for you.

You can find a live recording of Yuja Wang playing this too, which is fun to watch, but I think Browning gets more life out of it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Kwajecmh2c 

And finally his 7th sonata by the inimitable Sviatoslav Richter.  Richter premiered this sonata in the 1940's and his recordings remain the gold standard.  My dad saw Richter play this in Philadelphia in the 1950's or 1960's and he relayed that Richter played the piano so hard that it was shaking left and right a good 3-4 inches, but it didn't rattle Richter.  When he finished, he played the 3rd movement again as an encore.  Here's the whole thing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wsjc6PM5wxg 

I'll highlight a few good things about the sonata.  First is the opening 25 seconds -- I don't want to say it opens in complete cacophany, because there's a hummable melody there at the beginning, but it's pretty chaotic, yet appealing.  At least to me.  My favorite part of the first movement is another moment of cacophony -- Start at 3:25, where he starts building -- up to that theme your heard at the 25-second mark, but then, at 3:47 to 3:52 -- what on earth is that?  Chaotic but with drive and direction.  You can't describe it -- how could Prokofiev have thought of that, and then written it down?

We'll skip to the third movement, which, believe it or not, I played. It took a few months, but it's easier than it sounds.  It starts at 13:55, and although both rhythmic and hummable, it's hard to count out.  Most 7/8's can be counted in 2+2+3 or something like that, but not this one until 14:57, where you finally get a 12-12-123 pattern to latch onto.  You get a slightly calmer middle section, but then back to the main theme at 16:22, which escalates in both volume and range until 17:06 when he starts banging out these repeated chords changing key constantly, until 17:16 when it comes completely unhinged until the final repeated octaves.  I've played it, and I still don't understand it.

BTW, that Richter recording is pretty intense, even by Richter's standards -- when I played the piece, I couldn't conjure that amount of intensity, even though I tried.  A more standard rendition comes again from Yuja Wang, who plays great (except for getting lost a little at 3:22), but her intensity is around 7, while Richter's is at 500... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7U-L_n9tAJM

Group D: 2023-04-25: CS202: Chick Corea
Group E: 2023-04-25: CS202: Chick Corea

Music of the day honors Chick Corea, who died in February, 2021 at the age of 80.  Corea was a pioneering jazz pianist who effortlessly switched from acoustic to electric and back again.  Although I like his electronic work, I'll feature a few acoustic performances that stand out to me.  The first two are duets with vibraphonist Gary Burton which at least to me, makes me wish that there were more recordings like these, that simply make you feel good for listening.  First "Duet Suite":

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4UBy6BlEtc 

And "La Fiesta" -- I can't find the studio version on youtube that I want, so here's a live video:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Uok_WpjCTc 

Another recording I can't find on youtube is Corea's "Fanstasy for Two Pianos" recorded with Friedrich Gulda in 1983.  Here's a data point for storing your own music and not always relying on streaming (I do have a stored copy, fortunately) -- and I'll note that since I first wrote this (February, 2021), Warner Classics released this recording in 2022 - Enjoy: https://www.warnerclassics.com/release/mozart-corea-gulda 

And Naxos has it too: 190296268625

Group A: 2021-02-18: CS360: Liszt
Group C: 2022-09-20: CS494: Liszt

A few days ago, my sister sent me a New York Times article on the pianist Benjamin Grosvenor and how he is influenced by other pianists as he plays Liszt's Piano Sonata.  I'll put a link to the article at the end here.  I think Liszt's Piano Sonata is a bit of a chore (30 minutes long), but it prompts me to share my five favorite recordings of Liszt.  In case you don't know, Franz Liszt was the world's first rock star (or the second, if you think Niccolo Paganini was) touring Europe in the mid 1800's giving sold-out piano concerts to gobs of swooning ladies who would fight over his cigar butts left on the piano.  He followed this up years later by moving into a monastery in Rome and trying to become a priest.   You can't make this stuff up.

Regardless, Liszt is an underrated composer, because he wrote a lot of showy music for his concerts.  While some of these are throwaways, his music endures and has still influenced generations of composers.  You will recognize his 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody, which is popular enough to have been played by Bugs Bunny:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzeFyKiPHZ8 

All of these are from the 1960's:

In no particular order: #1 & 2 - Transcendental Etudes 1 and 2.  He wrote 12 of these extremely hard piano pieces.  The first two are short, and while the first is brash, ending nearly just as it begins, the second is startling in its violence and rhythmic shifts.  Listen to that one a few times until you can sing along -- that's how you'll appreciate how crazy that was in the 1800's.  The Soviet virtuoso Lazar Berman completely slays these two:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wh9F35RKWLs 

#3 Mephisto Waltz #1 played by John Ogdon.  Although Liszt wanted to be a priest, he wrote quite a bit of "satanic" music.  I don't find this piece satanic, BTW -- it's just a great piece of music.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zO9ogWyPDk 

#4. Back to Lazar Berman with the Spanish Rhapsody.  The two themes in this piece come from Spain and many, many composers used them in "Spanish" compositions.  This has always been one of my favorites, especially from 9:45 to the end, which is not subtle, but breathlessly powerful:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdJV3QcZfDg 

#5: Gyorgy Cziffra plays Hungarian Rhapsody #6.  Frankly, this isn't my favorite piece in the world, but I love videos of Cziffra playing the piano -- check out how he alternates his 4th and 5th fingers playing those repeated octaves at 5:30.  The opening announcer sounds kinda like a tool, doesn't he?  Cziffra's life journey is epic.  You can find his autobiography online and it's worth the read.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wnXcq8Gk7Y 

BTW, a 25-year old Martha Argerich gives an even more exciting performance of that Rhapsody on the following link.  She doesn't alternate her fingers, but rips off those octaves just like Cziffra:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhInwkq4nAw 

Oh yeah -- the NYT article that started me thinking about Liszt: https://www.nytimes.com/2021-02-15/arts/music/benjamin-grosvenor-piano-liszt-classical-music.html

Group A: 2021-02-23: CS360: Chicago
Group D: 2023-01-31
Group E: 2023-01-31

This one hit my random play yesterday.  My guess is that you all have heard of the band Chicago, and relegate them to "elevator music that my parents/grandparents liked because music was really bad back then."  Today's links are from their first album, made in 1969, called "Chicago Transit Authority" (before the real Chicago Transit Authority made them change their name).  While you can hear some traces of what they become, this was the late 1960's, so there a lot of great straight ahead rock, and even some really horrible free-form stuff that never should have been put to vinyl.

Some selected tracks:

"I'm a Man", which you probably wouldn't recognize as Chicago:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBGyFrHF1eU

"Listen":
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l76g3AawTiA 

"Questions 67 and 68": A schizophrenic alternation of Terry Kath's gritty guitar and Peter Cetera's bubble-gum singing.:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GLfoVuic8Y 

"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is": By far the biggest hit from the album, but again, it's 1969, so you have to endure a 75-second free-form piano solo, which of course they cut from the single:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uy0ldI_1HA 

"Beginnings": Probably the more enduring hit because it translates nicely to the elevator and dentist's office, but don't let that deter you -- it's a superbly constructed and performed song.  If I'm bored someday, I'll relate it to the 3rd movement of Sibelius' 5th symphony.  But I'm not that bored today.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lI-BMDnti4c 

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-02-25: CS360: Brahms

We'll feature the German composer Brahms, who lived in the late 1800's.  I won't talk too much about him except for the fact that my dad irrationally hated Brahms' music, so I had to learn it all after I went to college.  Not bad, because it gave me a clean and unbiased slate.  Here's my top five, which I'll do roughly from shortest to longest.

Hungarian Dance #5 performed by Vaclav Neumann and the Gewandhausorchester Leipzig -- I think it's hard not to love this piece and this is a great performance: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqBxQISK1Jg 

The 4th movement, "Ronda Alla Zingareze" from Piano Quartet #1, played by Rudolf Serkin and the Busch Quartet in 1949.  The recording is, well, 1949, but these guys have passion and drive.  Random fact: there's a really creepy French movie called "Monsieur Hire", which features the trio of this movement when he was in creeper mode.  Pretty effective, although I'm not recommending that you actually see the movie... Serkin was at his best with Brahms:
https://youtu.be/ob66nlkV0Rw?t=1869 

Second movement of his second piano concerto, played by Geza Anda with Hans Rosebaud conducting in the late 1950's.  I think this is the best single movement that Brahms wrote -- good logical structure, interplay between the piano and orchestra, and lots of fire and passion.  I'm giving this recording some love, since it only has one view (mine) on youtube.  I discovered it because of UT's subscription to the Naxos Music Library, hidden away in a box set of Rosebaud's recordings, and I think that Anda knocks it out of the park, especially that great ending!  If you're looking for other great recordings, look for Sviatoslav Richter with Lorin Maazel conducting.  
(this link has 33 likes, and is better than the one below).
https://youtu.be/elTfgkr9Q5k?t=1023 

Or this one (with just my one like)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KM-Q3jC0ZE 

The first movement of his fourth symphony.  Brahms wrote four symphonies, and his fourth symphony is rare to me because when I hear the first movement, I usually have to listen to the other three.  The climax of this movement simply screams.  Recording by the great Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony in 1951:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qE9BovVAjFA 

Final movement of his piano quintet, played by Maurizio Pollini and the Quartetto Italiano in 1980.  When I was a freshman in college, my roommate was given some cast-off classical records, which he certainly didn't want, so he gave them to me, and it included this one.  Remember, dad hated Brahms, so I didn't have any in my music collection.  What struck me was that horrible picture of the 2nd violinist.  Was that really the best picture of the photo shoot?  The others must have been terrible.  The performance is fantastic.  The whole quintet is long (45 minutes) and worth every second.  The fourth movement stands out because it's one of Brahm's greatest endings, and as the other recordings here attest, Brahms wrote some great endings.  This ending goes from the 8:37 mark over two minutes until the end of the piece.  Dr. Plank says to give it a listen:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w36iKi_5kr8 

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-03-02: CS360: Schelemo
Group C: 2022-11-17: CS484: Schelemo

The piece "Schelemo", by American composer Ernest Bloch (who lived until 1944) may well be the greatest piece of music that you've never heard before.  Who on earth is Ernest Bloch?  Well, he wrote this rhapsody for Cello and Orchestra, and it is mesmerizing, magical, you name it.  Most cello music has too many "sick cow" moments -- this one just has great wailing moments.  Give it a try -- I know it's 20 minutes, but you go through the range of emotions with this one, and when you get to know it, trust me, you'll wail along!  My favorite performance by far is Emanuel Feuermann on cello and Leopold Stokowski conducting, from 1940.  Feuermann's got the moaning down, and I think (and this is just me) that he hits some of those notes just a shade sharp on purpose to make it extra unsettled.  It's too good!

#2 is a good random play moment.  One great perk of being at UT is that you get access to Naxos' classical music library, which is huge.  My M.O. when I work is to listen to random stuff from Naxos.  A few days ago, I got Martinu's third piano trio, which as a really cool piece of music -- always nice to get a good surprise, at my age: Track 6 from https://utk-naxosmusiclibrary-com.proxy.lib.utk.edu/catalogue/item.asp?cid=UP0072-2  - here's a performance on youtube, which is ok:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FomrA2D6Emk&list=OLAK5uy_mhXw-sxn89roS3XjBDmwN85JlbYk5fXnc&index=9 
-- If you want to tell me that the cello has some "sick cow" moments there, I won't disagree.

#3 is a piece that #2 reminded me of, while I was listening -- the last movement to Schumann's first violin sonata.  This was a clear moment of inspiration from the older Schumann who was very near his mental breakdown at the end of his life:

Group A: 2021-03-04: CS360: Weather Report
Group D: 2023-02-07: CS360: Weather Report
Group E: 2023-02-07: CS360: Weather Report

Some early "fusion" jazz by the group "Weather Report", which for this album had three musicians who would be on anyone's jazz hall-of-fame list: Joe Zawinul on keyboards, Wayne Shorter on sax, and the incredible but tragically flawed Jaco Pastorius on bass.  A lot of Weather Report's albums are hard listening, but the few they made with Pastorius showcase everyone.  Here are three good tracks from the album.  #1 is the song "Birdland", which gets a little jingly (it was used as a TV theme song at one point), but if you look past that, it's a great composition and performance:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Fm10whccto 

#2: "Palladium" -  all Jaco, all Wayne, all Joe, all of the time:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohAvkuxqCe0 

#3: "Havona" - my favorite track on the album.  You get the idea:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVYk5NKpghI 

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-03-16: CS360: Beethoven's 7th

Just hitting my random play is my favorite Beethoven Symphony - the 7th.  The 7th typically comes in 5th place when most people rank Beethoven (the typical order is 9, 5, 3, 6, 7, 1, then 2, 4 and 8 in no particular order).  In the realm of classical music, Beethoven was the first Led Zeppelin -- a real head-banger, and the 7th has three head-banging movements (the first after all of the pastoral introduction, the third and the fourth) which simply grow in intensity.  The 4th movement's in particular sounds like a freight train creaking down the tracks with unstoppable momentum, and its ending, besides being totally logical is ecstatic and joyful!  Five stars says Dr. P.  When you're looking for recordings of Beethoven's symphonies, always start with Arturo Toscanini.  This great recording from the 1930's has been recently remastered, and it's a gem:

Group A: 2021-03-18: CS360: Tower of Power
Group D: 2023-02-28: CS360: Tower of Power
Group E: 2023-02-28: CS360: Tower of Power

Music of the day: There's no better music to help you finish your lab than Tower of Power.  They are a long-running group from Oakland, CA, whose lineup has gone through lots of changes, but they always feature four things:

1. A powerful horn section, typically with a stellar sax player.
2. Tongue-and-cheek vocals
3. Really good keyboards & guitars
4. Bass and drums that you often don't pay attention to, but when you do, you are floored by how they drive everything else.

Three classic songs that feature all of the above:

"What is Hip?" -- The horns, guitar and vocals grab  your attention, but listen to that bass line!  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAatPPEaZDA 

"Only So Much Oil In The Ground" -- Quite topical in 1975 --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrxRJ9HlfZk 

"Soul Vaccination" -- Again, check out the bass and drum interplay.  In particular, check out when the vocals start -- if you count each measure as eight beats, you'll note that the bass always drops out on beats 4 and 5, and the drum always plays on the beat on 4 and 5.  It makes for really great interplay.  They continue during the sax solo (2:00), so you can hear five separate things at the same time:

1. The sax solo -- Lenny Pickett freewheeling
2. Baritone sax, "the doctor" always playing the same pattern on the one.
3. The other horns in unison, always starting off the one.
4. Rocco on the bass, doing whatever he wants, but dropping out on 4 and 5.
5. David on the drums, doing whatever he wants, but always playing on the beat on 4 and 5.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46hd6DZS0ww 

And instrumentals which are essential for when you need to finish that lab (or in my case, finish that grant proposal):

"Squib Cakes" --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvJH0x1CTho 

"Walking Up Hip Street" --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3k1TUOUfg4 

"Ebony Jam" --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iG9Xgj54c4U 

"Boys from the Bay" (live) --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9C1B-EbBSUw 

If you were around for when the Knoxville Band "Gran Torino" existed, you'll note the Tower of Power influence....

Group A: 2021-03-23: CS360: Oscar Peterson and Art Tatum

When I was growing up, my dad's pinnacle of piano playing contained one person: The jazz pianist Art Tatum.  When dad lived in Pittsburgh in the 1950's Tatum had an engagement at a bar for a week, and dad went every night.  You may see where I get some of my obsessive behavior... Dad played the recordings of Tatum so much when I was young that I don't even hear them when they play; however, Tatum is a stunning pianist (who was also legally blind, btw).  Here's an example of Tatum's virtuosity:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_lCL04CT_Q 

In second place for dad was Oscar Peterson, who also commanded a breathtaking technique, but produces much warmer music and far more "swing", in my opinion.  I was lucky enough to see Peterson with dad in Philadelphia in the early 1980's and he was stunning indeed!  So you'll get more Oscar.  My personal favorite is "Put on a happy face," crappy recording and all -- music that makes you feel good:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inVtXQ_bqN4 

"Days of Wine & Roses" shows how well the Peterson Trio could swing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ypoE5YB8hc 

"Con Alma" is a guilty pleasure of Peterson with full orchestra backing him:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qG4zPnOr4U 

And if you want to see fast fingers in motion, "Blues Etude" was his live showstopper:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdd5pn1xs7M

Group A: 2021-03-25: CS360: Yes Tales and Steve Hackett
Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-03-21 
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-03-21 

To prog rock.  An esoteric question -- what do the songs "Ritual -- Nous sommes du soleil" by Yes and "Racing in A" by Steve Hackett have in common, besides the fact that none of you have heard of them, not to mention none of you know who Steve Hackett is...  The answer: Both feature passages in 23/8.  That's a pretty odd time signature, no?  The Yes treatment is particularly intriguing as it goes on for a couple of minutes, mixing vocals, which are subdivided into (9-7-7) along with the others, which subdivided into (5-5-6-7).  Here's a picture (no, I didn't draw that for you, but a few years ago when I was explaining it to a friend who was interested):

junk-yes.jpg

It starts at the 2:00 mark.  The rest of the song, like the giant album itself, is filled with great parts intermixed with the overblown and truly tedious.  
https://youtu.be/xQaYwTRLdCM?t=102 

Steve Hackett was the guitarist for the band Genesis during their prog-rock years (as opposed to their later pop years), and when he left Genesis, he put out a few albums that most definitely continued the Genesis vibe.  I've always liked the song "Racing in A", which features a lot of rhythmic shifting.  The part here is in 23, as well, subdivided (11-12) -- I was bored when it hit the random play in my car, and when I counted it out, I was surprised that the Yes song wasn't the only one in the world in 23.  I don't have many friends.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-03-30: CS360: De Severac

The french composer Deodat De Severac is pretty unknown, and did not write much music, but what he did write is colorful and captivating.  Try the set of 5 "Cerdana" etudes, played by Aldo Ciccolini --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLowEiWmYMs 
-- you'll be glad you discovered these pieces, just like I was when I discovered them!

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-04-01: CS360: Herbie Hancock
Group E: 2024-01-25: Herbie Hancock

Herbie Hancock was a jazz keyboardist, who started out playing straight jazz, but then rode the various trends in jazz in the 1960's and 1970's, eventually making the first truly successful "Fusion" album, "Head Hunters."  I saw Herbie in something like 1982 when my Dad took me to a concert of Hancock and Oscar Peterson, playing solo piano jazz in Philadelpha.

I'll give you three famous Herbie Hancock recordings.  First is "Watermelon Man" from 1962, when he was playing "straight" jazz piano:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_QkGAaYtXA0 

Next is "Maiden Voyage", from the 1965 album with the same name, where Herbie lays down a really mellow vibe and lets it breathe.  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmRQ0PBtXU 

And last is "Chameleon", the lead off song from 1973's album "Head Hunters," which was the first jazz album to sell over 1,000,000 copies.  Besides the really catchy bass line and punchy sax line, the thing that I think makes this a great song is the bridge section which starts at 7:42, and propels you do these great chord changes and drum fill, which starts at 12:25.  It's amazing how many current jazz musicians credit this song as the one that made them want to play jazz!

Group A: 2021-04-06: CS360: Trout quintet, Jacqueline de Pre, Turina, Shostakovich
Group E: 2023-04-06: Jacqueline de Pre, Turina, Shostakovich

I was on my Naxos random play yesterday, and Schubert's "Trout" quintet came up.  If you look up "100 best pieces of chamber music" on Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_100_Chamber_(ABC)), this is the #1, which, for the life of me, I can't understand.  To me, it just sounds like "classical music sounding like classical music."  Music that makes you look at your phone to see when you think it will end.  It's just me.  You may differ.  Regardless, here's a star-studded video of five really famous soloists (well, Zubin Mehta was a famous conductor) who are all very pleased with themselves by making this video of the Trout.  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZdXoER96is 

The pianist and the cellist became quite the famous couple, and eventually married.  Her performance of Elgar's cello concerto is widely considered the best of the work.  Like the Trout, this concerto loses my attention pretty quickly.  It is fun to watch how she plays that fast movement and doesn't have to watch her hands (I assume cellists don't have to watch their hands -- I don't play cello, so I don't know).

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUgdbqt2ON0 

An underrated composer who excelled at chamber music was Joaquin Turina, from Spain.  I think I like all of his chamber music better than that Trout quintet.  Here's his first piano trio, again with some heavy-hitters as the musicians.  You won't like the beginning, because it's irritating, but the rest of the piece is great:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3pg8aiy3SA 

And while I'm cracking on Elgar's cello concerto, you may wonder, "Is there a better cello concerto?  Don't they all sound like mooing cows?"  Try Shostakovich's second cello concerto.  It starts off *very* slowly, and yes, it starts just like a mooing cow.  The orchestration is nuts, I'm guessing because Shostakovich didn't want to drown out the cello with a bunch of violins.  So you get a lot of flute, horns and timpani.  My favorite part starts at 9:16. Build up to this crazy fanfare of just horns and drums.  Then snap!  The cello takes on the same fanfare backed up by -- wait for it -- a tamborine!  I don't know if Shostakovich had just gotten a new shipment of edibles (or whatever their equivalent was in the 1950's), but this piece is completely off the wall, but it's a really good listen.  Give it a few tries -- it grows on you.

Group A: 2021-04-08: CS360: In honor of Jeff (Greta, Black Keys, Darkness, O-Zone, San Jose)
Group E: 2023-09-22: CS302: In honor of Jeff (Greta, Black Keys, Darkness, O-Zone, San Jose)

My son just signed an offer to sell his house -- to underscore how crazy the house market is right now, he never listed it!  In honor of his good news, I'll give you some links to music that Jeff introduced me to to over the last 20 years.

- Greta Van Fleet has been his latest.  I grew up on Led Zeppelin, so this doesn't really feel as new to me as it does to him, but it's still high quality.  Example:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2CRzXAPPEY 

- The Black Keys.  In fact pretty much the only way I'm introduced to music that was recorded after 2000 is through my children.  The thing I love about the Black Keys is the pacing of their music -- not rushed; not too slow;  just right:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tPsaSPraks 

- The Darkness:  More in the Led Zeppelin lineage, this time from 2003.  I think we were driving to Orlando on one of those family vacations, and Jeff played this Darkness album for something like 8 hours of the 10 hour drive.  This song cracks me up every time I hear it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YhH3BBgw0Ww 

- O-Zone - Dragnostea Din Tei (the Numa Numa song).  If you, like me, had kids in high school when this song came out, you couldn't avoid it.  Kitschy and dated, it's still pretty catchy, isn't it?  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YnopHCL1Jk8 

- Burt Bacharach - Do You Know The Way to San Jose.  It's not often that your 15-year old soon-to-be son (he's 35 now, so you can do the math) puts on elevator music from the 1960's and then tells you how awesome it is, but it's true -- it happened.  And I'll give Jeff credit, because seeing as how I had listened to Burt Bacharach in actual elevators and dentist offices for my entire life, I was skeptical -- and wrong.  Despite being so dated, this, and a lot of Bacharach's songs/arrangements are really fun listening:

Group A: 2021-04-13: CS360: VDGG: Scorched Earth; The Pretenders.
Group E: 2023-09-26: CS302: VDGG: Scorched Earth; The Pretenders.

Music of the day #1: "Scorched Earth", by Van Der Graaf Generator, 1975.   When you start listening to Van Der Graaf Generator, you should realize that you've gone too far down the 1970's "Progressive Rock" rabbit hole.  Maybe you started with the music of Yes and Jethro Tull, and then moved onto Genesis and King Crimson, and you find yourself at VDGG.  You'll break free, but before you do, you should thoroughly enjoy this song, with its epic intensity matched by epic lyrics, featuring the words "spoor" and "ambuscade", which you should look up, even if you won't incorporate them into conversation:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9coXl3qEi0 

Music of the day #2: The song "Brass in Pocket" hit my random play today, and made me remember how great The Pretender's first album was (1980, named, "The Pretenders" along with an EP that followed).   I won't give much commentary, since I imagine most of you don't care about a quirky rock album written 20 years before your were born, but if you're in the mood, it's worth the exploration, so check it out on wikipedia and youtube.  My favorite hits are from the EP:

- Talk of the Town:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC7Z3BeWoSM

- And Message of Love:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7IRnOa0e0Bs

- But the more quirky songs are what make the album complete: "Private Life" about a throwaway affair from the perspective of the one who doesn't care:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOEq5JeWDnQ

- "Porcelain", inhabiting the perspective of one who has had too much, after a really good instrumental:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5tp7_gsod4

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-04-15: CS360: Kullervo
Group C: 2022-09-15: CS494: Kullervo

When it comes to classical music, in my opinion everyone overvalues Mozart and undervalues Sibelius.  I never can understand why everyone loves Mozart -- his music simply sets my mind wandering, typically to "when is this going to be over?"  It's the classical music that people think of as "classical music", and if you don't have the Mozart gene, you're probably going to dislike all of classical music.  Fortunately, I had a father that played classical music all of the time (not Mozart, BTW), so I developed that love early and it wasn't stymied by Mozart in the "music appreciation" class I took in high school.

But enough about Mozart, and onto Sibelius.  Sibelius gets relegated to "national music of Finland," because before Sibelius, there was no "music of Finland."  He was trained as a composer in Germany, not Finland, but I digress...  Sibelius remains one of the greatest composers of orchestral music -- Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, Mahler, Shostakovich, Sibelius, and not in that order.  On another day, I'll give you 10 Sibelius recordings to listen to, but today, there's only one -- Kullervo --
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxMbuVstq0I 
-- It's an overblown piece in five movements that goes on way too long, so just listen to the first two movements, which may be summed up in a single word: EPIC.  Totally epic.  The first movement conveys power.  POWER.   You know you're in for a long, hard-fought night.  And the second movement conveys pathos.  This is not a happy man, who has not had a happy life, but it's real and it taps into raw emotion.  Which is why you should give it a listen.  It's so good.  Listen to it a few times.  10 or more.  You'll agree.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group A: 2021-04-20: CS360: Inspired by the next KSO season: Pathetique, Sibelius 1, Tchaikovsky 1.

The Knoxville Symphony has just released their 2021-2022 programs, so I'll give them a shout-out, and let you know which ones I'll be going to.  They may well have a good student discount, so I recommend going.  Knoxville is lucky to have a very nice symphony with a really good conductor, so it's good to support them.  That said, there's absolutely zero chance that will I pony up my hard-earned cash to watch Vivaldi's "Four Seasons" or Rachmaninoff's epically boring second symphony... 

November 18 & 19: https://knoxvillesymphony.com/concert/tchaikovskys-pathetique/,  Tchaikovsky's 6th Symphony "Pathetique."  Tchaikovsky's monster symphonies are 4, 5 and 6, and #6 is the most famous by a long shot.  It's especially sad that Tchaikovsky died 9 days after its premier.  The first movement is epic with an enormously famous and not unschmalzy second theme, but the best part to me is the absolute bone-crushing dispair towards the end.  The second movement is a wistful dance movement in 5/4 time with some good Tchaikovsky solemness in the middle.  The third movement is an exhilarating march, which is one of my favorite symphony movements of all times -- I can't wait to see it live, as I've never seen this symphony before.  The 4th movement is slow and depressing -- famously so, but typically happy to skip it and instead feel upbeat after the third movement.  I guess I should give you a recording.  Here's an old and good one: William Steinberg & the Pittsburgh Symphony in the 1950's:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDvhprI4xU4 

- Schmaltzy theme -- 4:30

- Recap section, featuring a great buildup to bone crushing dispair: 11:30 to 13:45.

- Second movement: Around the 18:00 mark.

- Third movement: I like George Szell's recording better:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dMhBcIVjf8 
starting 26:44.  I'd be remiss if I didn't include Evgeny Mravinsky's stellar performance:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHO2Wr9yQeQ 

- Fourth movement - just skip it.

- February 17&18: https://knoxvillesymphony.com/concert/mozart-piano-concerto-no-25/  - Sibelius' First Symphony.  It's a tragedy that the headliner is some stupid Mozart Piano Concerto.  I've already had to promise to my wife that I won't whine about Mozart for the first half of the concert.  Maybe I'll show up late.  Sibelius 1 is powerful, emotional, well-structured, consuming, you name it.  I drove to Nashville to see it for the first time in 2014, and then when the Naples Symphony did it a year later, I flew down to see mom and go to both performances.  So I won't miss this one either.  Maybe I'll go to both nights...   I'm partial to Osmo Vanska's recordings of this symhpony.  Unfortunately, there's not one link so I'll give you four:

1st Movement:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZrVkMImZVU 

2nd Movement:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJyieWEKmf0 

3rd Movement:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zudhfa5ydh0 

Last Movement:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Vm23K7oJOI 


March 17-18: https://knoxvillesymphony.com/concert/michelle-cann-plays-tchaikovsky/  -- Tchaikovsky's 1st Piano Concerto, which you never want to miss.  It's paired with Brahms' second symphony which is fine, but doesn't get my blood going.  Emil Gilels plays the third movement like his hair is on fire in this 1955 recording with Fritz Reiner and the Chicago symphony:

Group A: 2021-04-22: CS360: Dixie Dregs
Group B: 2022-03-01: CS360: Dixie Dregs
Group C: 2022-03-01: CS302: Dixie Dregs
Group D: 2023-11-02: CS302: Dixie Dregs

Yesterday I had the song "I'm Freaking Out" by the Dixie Dregs hit my random play.  It takes a little time to get going, but this is quite a feat of instrumentalism: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MjbawuqFsPc

The Dixie Dregs were a virtuoso instrumental rock group composed of musicians who had gone to the University of Miami together.  They were headed by guitarist Steve Morse, from the bands Deep Purple and Kansas.  Regardless, they made great albums from 1977 to 1982.  I was fortunate enough to see them in 1989 in Philadelphia with my good friend Norman (https://engineering.tufts.edu/people/faculty/norman-ramsey), and they were inspiring.    I'll give some youtube links, but you can't go wrong with the albums "What If", "Dregs of the Earth" and "Unsung Heroes".  I'll give you a song from each:

"Cruise Control" from "Unsung Heroes" -- a great song for the last hour of that 12-hour drive, or when you're trying to finish up that lab or grant proposal:  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD9j0VfX7QU 

"Hereafter" from "Dregs of the Earth" -- I was glad they played this one live, as it's always been one of my favorites.  A little overblown at the end, but that's not a bad thing:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Zhg_tyuaxE 

"Ice Cakes" from "What If" -- great use of space and rhythm:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZX-ZNmMmDS4 

"Travel Tunes" from "What If" -- I'm not a real fan of the beginning, but after a little passage in 15/16 time, they hit a nice pocket in the middle:

Group A: 2021-04-27: CS360: Medtner Gm & PC3
Group D: 2023-03-30: Medtner Gm & PC
Group E: 2023-03-30: Medtner Gm & PC

We finish with two pieces from the Soviet composer Nikolai Medtner.  Medtner's music takes some repetitions to appreciate, so give these a few reps -- it's worth the effort.  First is his Gm Piano Sonata, Opus 22, played by the incomparable Emil Gilels.  This piece was my introduction to Medtner, on a CD of early recordings by Gilels.  It's a captivating piece, both savage and logical, so as I said above, give it a few listens.  The middle movement, which is only a few minutes is great -- he's just banging on these discordant chords -- too good:

The second piece is his third piano concerto -- all three of Medtner's concertos are great, but I'm partial to the rather slow-moving third, with alternations of bombast, passion and introspection.  This recording is an underrated concerto written by an underrated composer and played by a truly underrated pianist, Michael Ponti.  Any piano concerto played by Michael Ponti is worth listening to.  Again, take your time -- it's worth it: Youtube splits it into two parts:

Final sharing: I went through my Medtner phase in 2011 --- here I am in Paraty, Brazil, working on a talk that I was giving later that day at an Information Theory Workshop.  Two things always stand out to me when I see this photo: I was listening to Medtner's 3rd Piano Concerto, probably for the 40th time, and it's one of the few pictures where I look like my dad, and I'm happy that the picture helps me remember him.

Group C: 2021-08-19: CS202 and 494: The Doors.

Today's music comes from today's lecture, when the program used cout to print "Love me 2 times, baby."  This is a song by the 60's band "The Doors": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsP6EKAzEjI -- In 1967 (I was only a year old), this was edgy stuff, and now you probably hear it on elevators and dentist offices.  Two fun facts: That's not a bass, but Ray Manzarek on the keyboards.  Sure sounds like a bass, doesn't it?  Second, nice hemiola at 3:30 where John Densmore on drums is playing in two and three.   My favorite Doors song by far: LA Woman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHXjcdNIN-Q -- Jim Morrison died not too long thereafter, and that was that.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-08-24: CS202 and 494: Brian Kahanek

I stream classical music, largely because UT has streaming service from the Naxos Music Library.  For non-classical music, I own and don't stream, and for mindless tasks like moving lumber from the truck to the deck, etc, I pop random music on an SD card and let it rip.  Every now and then, I hear a song I like, but I don't know, usually because I bought an entire album for a different song.  That happened last weekend.  Many, many years ago, I bought the album "Real Life", by Brian Kahanek, just for the song "Gemini", which a staple of my son's Guitar Hero game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2C6A7u8-sI -- It's a hard song not to like!  But last weekend, the song "Love Deluxe" came on my random play -- I'm not sure if I had ever heard it before, but a breath of fresh air -- Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dFHBKJZLh0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-08-26 CS202 and 494: Tower of Power / Francis Rocco Prestia

As usual, random play spurs the music of the day, which is about the best bass player I've ever heard: Francis Rocco Prestia, from Tower of Power.  Sadly, Rocco died 11 months ago at the age of 69.  Article: https://www.guitarworld.com/news/legendary-tower-of-power-bassist-rocco-prestia-dies-aged-69 -- Chances are that you have never listened to Tower of Power, but when you do (hopefully today), you'll first notice the horns, then the vocals, and the great lyrics.  You probably won't pay attention to the bass, but if you do, you'll be floored.  Rocco is a "busy" bassist, but try to imagine the music without him.  The quintessential Rocco song (and really the quintessential Tower of Power song) is "What is Hip": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAatPPEaZDA

I'll give you three more links, which are all instrumentals, and I can attest (as can my sister) that when you need to finish that lab/paper/grant-proposal, there's nothing to propel you through like these three:

Sorry for repeating some links from last semester.  Rocco is worth it.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-08-31 CS202 and 494: Cream / Anne Queffelec
         2022-11-29 CS494: Cream / Anne Queffelec

The serendipity of random-play and random-stream gives you good songs and bad songs, but the good ones feel extra refreshing.  On the walk in from Fort Sanders today, I was treated to "I Feel Free", by Cream, the first "super trio" of Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  1967 maybe.  For being 50+ years old, this song stands the test of time -- it's under three minutes, so it won't take two much of your time to listen, and let me highlight a few things.  First, is the moment at 0:29, when the drums, which have just been understatedly tapping on the offbeat, have a tiny solo and switch the rhythm to being on the beat -- great.  Second is Eric Clapton's guitar solo whose first note (1:15) hits you like an AC current, and keeps your fingers in the socket until he starts wailing.  Third, I think one of the things that makes this song so effective is the combination of the spacy (and meaningless) lyrics and trippy melodic line, with the relentlessly forward driving bass and drums.  I can be in a crappy mood, and this song always gives me a good jolt!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prnbF8Eagdg

Changing directions completely, when I work, I stream from Naxos, and this performance of Scarlatti's K492 sonata is astoundingly nuanced, while still being pretty brisk.  I have no clue who Anne Queffelec is, but she nails it on this piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fZgt4fGU94

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-09-02 CS202 and 494: I'm Too Sexy

Well, I got this one confused, but I'll put it here anyway.  In CS202 this morning one of my input files had "Drop Dead Fred", and I said I'd put it into the music of the day.  Unfortunately, my memory failed me, and "Drop Dead Fred" was a movie in 1991 starring Pheobe Cates that I've never seen and that gets trashed by most anyone who reviewed it.  Instead, I was thinking of "Right Said Fred", which in 2006 put out a joke song called "I'm Too Sexy", that went viral.  Good or stupid?  Both?  You be the judge?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feyutvX4STc

Group C: 2021-09-07 CS202 and 494: Tony Rice, David Grisman

Yesterday in the car, a David Grisman song popped up on the random play, which inspires today's Music of the Day.  Grisman is a mandolin player from New Jersey, who pioneered a very catchy blend of bluegrass and jazz.  A mainstay in his group was a stupendous acoustic guitarist from Danville, Virginia named Tony Rice.  I never got to see Tony Rice, but I've seen Grisman a few times, the most memorable of which was when I found myself at the Black Mountain hippie festival east of Asheville.  Grisman's group was tight and fantastic, which was by and large lost on an audience of stoned man-buns, braided hair and dipper gourds... Here are few songs -- it can be easy not to pay attention to Rice's guitar playing, but try to -- he is really talented.
#1: An archtypical Grisman song if there was one: 16/16: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LExbHxC0W0U
#2: A good groove: Devlin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_id3lNku9E8
#3: Another good groove: Neon Tetra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-YhUjjCNkm0
#4: My personal favorite -- Fish Scale.  I had the pleasure of hearing Grisman and Doc Watson do this as a duet in a concert at Carson Newman.  Life takes you places: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fiAfyGzzz0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-09-09 CS 202 and 494: Weissenberg Rachmaninoff 3

This video was removed from Youtube for a while, so I'm happy it's back, and you should watch/listen to it while you can.  Alexis Weissenberg was a classical pianist born in Bulgaria in 1929.  In 1941, his family tried to escape from the German-occupied country and were captured and imprisoned in a concentration camp.  A guard heard him playing the accordion, and so liked his playing that he aided their escape to Turkey.  He had a long career as a virtuoso pianist, and although I grew up with a father who loved classical piano, I had never heard of him.  This video is fantastic for many reasons: One of the best piano concertos ever written (It's central to the movie "Shine", if you're bored), the stylish 1960's Italian audience with people wearing sunglasses indoors, the conductor who is clearly hamming it up for the camera, and Weissenberg's performance.  The feature of his playing that strikes me the most is how resolute he is -- there is not a wavering, weak or meek moment in the entire 45 minutes -- just forthright, athletic, crystal-clear piano playing.  If you can't stand 45 minutes, start at 40:11 to the end.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpy1hYdp6z8

Group C: 2021-09-14 CS 202 and 494 Rosalita / Lightning Strikes

These two come from the lecture notes for CS202 -- Hashing and Polymorphism.  In the first lecture, I used a two line lyric from the song "Rosalita" by Bruce Springsteen.  When I was in middle and high school everyone was in love with Bruce Springsteen, and I didn't get it until my older sister told me to listen to Rosalita.  Oh my -- definitely worthwhile listening.  Although at paean to being a rowdy teenager in high school, it ends on a bit of a sad/pathetic note to me.  Whatever, it's a great singalong, airguitaralong, airpiano song -- can always lift me from a bad mood: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC4bf67s5lQ -- sorry for the poor recording quality.

The second is a ludicrous song sent to me by my best friend from childhood, Dan.  We'll see if Dan has anything on youtube as he sings out in LA. Here we go: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q93H9-1Ffb4 -- Well, Dan picked up a used album, probably from a trash can, entitled "Thor Unchained" and fell in love the the song "Lightning Strikes Again".  Nonstop listening for multiple days.  So, every now and then (e.g. when I was writing the polymorphism lecture notes), it inhabits my brain: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfw8qPMt3iA

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-09-16 CS 202 and 494 Ramble On

Today was too busy to listen to music, which is a sad day.  So as he walked into the kitchen, I asked my wife's sister's daughter's husband, Chris, for a song of the day.  He said, "Ramble On".  A fine selection.  Of course, Led Zeppelin is so old that rather than being shocking, it's pretty much elevator music, but when you combine two seasoned studio musicians (Page & Jones), with a distinctive lead singer (Plant) and charismatic drummer (Bonham), you get a band that's both musically interesting and visceral.  We can pull this back to computer science -- C++ didn't render C irrelevant, which is a little surprising, so will Greta Van Fleet render Led Zeppelin irrelevant?  Jury's out.

"Ramble On" is a classic "chill" then "not chill" song that Zeppelin specialized in.  Good vibe, good bass, good screaching -- you can't go wrong: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzGBQerkvWs

So then I need to pick my favorite Led Zeppelin song, and that's a hard task, so I will choose two that are lesser known -- "How Many More Times" from their first album, where they go all out on an extended blues riff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Vbn2XQ7GPo and "The Rain Song", from their fifth album, which is a masterpiece of arranging, vibe, and the ability to make the music build.  Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRt4hQs3nH0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-09-21 CS 202 and 494 - Tito Puente

(There's a better Tito Later)

While prepping for class in the car yesterday (no, I wasn't driving), "Ran Kan Kan" by Tito Puente hit the random play.  If you haven't listened to any tunes by the "King of Latin Music", well then click these three links from his great 1984 album, "El Rey".  This is stuff that gets your blood going!

Group C: 2021-09-23 CS 202 and 494 Earth, Wind & Fire, Ramsey Lewis
Group E: 2024-02-06 CS 202 and 494 Earth, Wind & Fire, Ramsey Lewis

On my random play yesterday came a Jazz classic from  the 1960's, the Song "If You've Got It, Flaunt It", by the Ramsey Lewis Trio.  Lewis and his group knew how to lay down a groove and keep it going: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GNtOZZtkHs

There are some good Ramsey Lewis videos on youtube -- what a fun act to watch -- The In Crowd from 1973: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOO42RbEvPw

Wade in the Water from 1990: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyNRmZiRd9g

Playing drums on "If You've Got It, Flaunt It" back in 1967?  Maurice White, who later became one of the lead vocalists for Earth, Wind & Fire.  Here's one of my favorite EWF songs that you don't find on any Greatest Hits albums: "Mighty Mighty" from Open Our Eyes (1974): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKljHXYTRy0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-09-28 Terry, TOP Only So Much Oil

Today's MOTD features my sister Terry, who is a Rock Star (literally - she's a Geology professor at Columbia and a recipient of the McArthur Fellowship.  Quite a big deal).  I'm featuring Terry because a local New York news channel is running a feature on Women Scientists, and Terry was the subject of the feature last week.  The interviewer:  Audrey Puente, daughter of none other than Tito Puente, who was featured last week on my MOTD!  How cool is that?  Unfortunately, Terry did not know this tidbit during the interview, so we don't get any cool Tito Puente stories.  Regardless, enjoy Terry's video: https://www.fox5ny.com/video/981959

For the music of the day, we'll return to Tower of Power as Terry starts each semester of her undergraduate geology class with a topical classic: "Only So Much Oil In The Ground" -- love the lyrics, as Lenny rhymes "Earth" with "Dearth": Here's the studio version: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrxRJ9HlfZk

Live -- typically tragic that you barely see Rocco even though he's tearing it up on bass as always: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGVrh-obV4M

But then he gives a youtube lesson on the bass line (although I think it's too slow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_5txk-Y9EM

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-10-05 Les McCann - Compared to What
Group E: 2023-11-07 Les McCann - Compared to What

I had no idea that this video existed!  I was simply searching for the song, and there it was, on youtube, live, from 1969, Montreaux, France.  This recording either made Les McCann rich, or it should have, because it sold millions.  You have to remember that this was 1969 (I was three, so it's not like I remember it), smack in the middle of the Vietnam War, and people were angry.  Angry.  Racism was taken for granted.  And there weren't outlets for anger like today.  So here's a song with a great groove and talented musicians and lyrics that while uneven, are direct and vent all of that anger.  Anger at the president.  Anger at the church.  Anger at poverty.  Even anger at dogs, as misguided as that seems.  I always figured McCann ad made up the lyrics on the fly, but the song was written by Gene McDaniels.  My only complaint (beside the dog thing) is that the last verse hits it out of the park until that King Tut thing makes it sound inane.  Just one last really good line could have cemented it.  Opportunity lost.  Whatever, give it a few listens, because this is an outstanding recording by five pretty unknown musicians: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCDMQqDUtv4

As I explore, the song was first recorded by Roberta Flack.  Same lyrics (modulo a few tamer words), even the dumb King Tut thing, but a much tamer performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDUk9Lsy_yQ

Here's another recording, by Brian Auger and the Oblivion Express.  Dude knows how to work that Hammond organ, but in my opinion the vocals are overproduced, so you don't get the anger: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7BA1MvZJ5I

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-10-07 Cowbells - Stone Free, Low Rider, Up in Smoke
Group E: 2023-11-09 Cowbells - Stone Free, Low Rider, Up in Smoke

The piano and drum intro from last tuesday's MOTD (Les McCann, Compared to What) features very prominent use of a cowbell, an eclectic and really effective percussion instrument, which led my mind to wander about great songs that feature the cowbell.  I'll highlight two of my favorites.

#1: "Stone Free" by Jimi Hendrix, which actually uses the cowbell in the exact same manner as "Compared to What".  It's an underrated Hendrix song, with groove, drive, great vocals, great bass, and of course, great guitar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66COu2TpcyQ

#2: "Low Rider" by War.  Also a great groove, but a different use of the Cowbell: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsrqKE1iqqo

I was first introduced to "Stone Free" by purchasing a greatest hits cassette of Jimi Hendrix.  "Low Rider" has an odder history.  It was probably my 13th birthday -- something like that -- and some friend gave me the vinyl soundtrack of the movie "Up In Smoke".  At the time, Cheech and Chong were a comedy duo whose shtick was being stoned all the time, and this was their first movie, basically the vicissitudes of two stoners.  Wikipedia says it pioneered the "stoner film" genre.  The soundtrack is about 15 skits of dudes being stoned, and "Low Rider".  What I find memorable, besides discovering a great song, is the fact that my parents did not vet this album, so I spent months listening to two guys celebrating being high all the time.  All the time.  Such is life when you're a youngest child in the 1970's and your parents pay no attention...  Cheech morphed into a good actor, both comedic and serious.  Chong did quite a few cameos on the comedy "That 70's Show", playing -- wait for it -- a stoner.

I'd be remiss to discuss cowbells without citing the "More Cowbell" skit from Saturday Night Live: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVsQLlk-T0s

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-10-12  - Cannonball

I don't have much time to write a MOTD today, so let me give you four links.  First came in an email from my sister this morning -- a song called "Cannonball" from the band "Soulive" -- crossing Tower of Power with Cannonball Adderley (I'm sure the song was named after Adderley) -- good stuff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldWfzPXLxMY

And while we're talking about Adderley, he was a high school teacher in Florida before moving to New York to pursue Jazz.  He's one of the finest alto soloists ever, making famous recordings in the 1950's with the Miles Davis lineup that featured John Coltrane on tenor.  Here's a good upbeat song from that time, called "Milestones" (solos go Adderley, then Davis, then Coltrane): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k94zDsJ-JMU

My two favorite Cannonball songs feature the same lineup of Cannonball (alto), Yusef Lateef (flute and reeds), Nate Adderley (trumpet), Joe Zawinul (piano), Sam Jones (Bass) and Louis Hayes.  Late 1960's.  The songs are similar, too -- fast soloing over a throbbing beat. The first one is more polished: Gemini, with a classic Adderley spoken intro: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ob3G2Fd1ZgE

The second one was written to commemorate John Coltrane and is called "Brother John" -- it's a little rawer and more uneven, and Nate devolves into making pretty much fart sounds on his trumpet, but it's still a great live performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSwuS8YedHM

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-10-14 - Happy Jazz
Group E: 2023-10-24 - Happy Jazz

I call today's MOTD "Happy Jazz" as these are three jazz songs that always make me happy.  They are all trios -- piano, bass, drums, and hopefully you'll put them on your feel-good playlists:

#1. "Put on a Happy Face", by the Oscar Peterson trio.  My dad only acknowledged two jazz pianists -- Art Tatum and Oscar Peterson, so this one was a staple growing up.  If you've ever heard the lyrics to "Put on a happy face", you'd probably want to punch someone, but fortunately this is just music with no lyrics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inVtXQ_bqN4

#2. "This Guy's In Love With You", by the Cedar Walton trio.  If you can stomach it, it's worth exploring the 1960's music of Burt Bacharach, even though it's total elevator music.  He was an incredibly talented composer ("Do you know the way to San Jose", "I say a little prayer"). In contrast to "Happy Face", the lyrics to "This Guy" are great, but again, this version has no lyrics -- just a piece of jazz to make you happy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mc-gkcMnmiw

#3. "Linus and Lucy", by the Vince Guaraldi trio.  Chances are you've heard this one if you've ever watched any Charlie Brown cartoons.  Tell me this doesn't make you feel good?  It's a true pity that Vince Guaraldi died before he turned 50: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x6zypc_LhnM

#4.  Ok, reading through this (I originally wrote it in 2021), I feel compelled to give you the original version of "This Guy's In Love With You", by Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass.  You'll see what I mean about elevator music, but classic stuff here from the 1960's.  "My hands are shakin' don't let my heart keep breaking...." https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppYnbbu1OmA

#5. Herb Alpert was in interesting person -- he played trumpet and made a ton of money with the album "Whipped Cream and Other Delights," but he was far more successful as a record executive (he's the "A" in "A&M Records"), which was highly successful at the time.  Regardless, there are two pretty happy songs on the album: The classic "Taste of Honey", where it's easy to see the Alpert was a better producer than trumpet soloist: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRGOm071sE0

And the very similar "Lollipops and Roses", which, although it sounds like game show music (It may have been, now that I think about it), still makes me happy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZmeyJ2KRY

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-10-21 - Music from Video Games

One of my CS494/594 students shared with me his MOTD, coming from the soundtrack for Paper Mario: The Origami King, which evidently has over 250 fully orchestrated songs.  His favorite -- the Great Sea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWKQQ2k1OAA

His email reminded me of the days when I played the Xbox (the original one) with the kids, and we were all addicted to Fuzion Frenzy and SSX3.  Totally addictive bass lines.  Here's the main one from Fuzion Frenzy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWScpRDr36k&list=PLhrK8zP7p2c6sHBWiRxWsxKhZQQ0-CiQn&index=23

And one of the mini-games -- I could have these on infinite loop: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5ZVFJteZIk&list=PLhrK8zP7p2c6sHBWiRxWsxKhZQQ0-CiQn&index=16

And SSX3 -- again, I'm not sure how many hours of my life have been spent listening to this, but probably most of the 2000's....  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrWb-EnLNrA&list=PLIhfW1iZz-LHk6eq4ItfFahiL-1TDQZQc

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-10-26: COSC 202 and 494 Bartok; Aaron Copland

This semester, I'm trying not to recommend too many 45-minute pieces of classical music, because you'll lose interest, so here are some classical snippets for you.  Bela Bartok was a Hungarian composer in the early part of the 20th century who wrote a lot of discordant music, a lot of which I can't stomach because it's just too noisy.  The rest is great, though, so I'll give you two Bartok links.  The first is the last movement of his "Concerto for Orchestra" that he wrote while living in the U.S. after fleeing Europe from WWII.  The opening minute is just fantastic -- repeatedly accelerating the rhythm while the strings furiously play to a crescendo.  The rest is good too, but the opening minute always gets me.  Performance is George Szell and the Cleveland Symphony from 1966.  Szell is always a reliable go-to, and he & the Cleveland rip this one to shreds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWKtXZ_735w

Bartok did a lot of resetting Eastern European folk songs, where he'd take a simple melody and vary the harmony in often astonishing ways.  I think the best example of this is his set of six Romanian Folk Songs.  If you're dabbling with piano, grab the sheet music, because these are very playable, and when you play them, you can really "get" the harmonies.  I'll give Helene Grimaud some love with a really nice performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OoaKYJrXoVw

While I'm prattling about folk songs, I forget who the composer was, but the quote was something like "who cares about resetting folk songs -- pretty much all you can do is make them louder!"  The quote steers me to the end of Aaron Copland's "Appalachian Spring", which is a ludicrous and ironic amplifying of "Simple Gifts", ruining the end of an otherwise really nice piece of music.  I won't bother with a link.  Just take my word for it.

But I won't leave with a negative impression of Copland.  You've probably heard "Fanfare for the Common Man" 100 times, but crank up the volume and listen to it again.  Were I starting a country, this would be my national anthem to play when my athletes win medals at the Olympics.  Too good! (Leonard Bernstein on the baton -- the best at conducting Copland, Bernstein and Gershwin): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=roUBCqWICq4

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 10/29/2021: 202 and 494 : Ahmad Jamal
Group D: 10/29/2021: 360 : Ahmad Jamal
Group E: 10/29/2021: 202 : Ahmad Jamal

Back to some Jazz.  The year is 1990, and I'm in Seattle giving my first talk at a technical conference, the second ACM Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming (PPoPP -- https://dl.acm.org/doi/proceedings/10.1145/99163).  The talk went well, and on the day after I was in a great mood as I played hooky, having lunch at a Ramen restaurant and then going to a used record store to kill some time.  1990, in case you didn't read the year before.  I ended up buying an album by Ahmad Jamal -- "Stepping Out with a Dream", which I'm sure I bought for the album cover, and that great suit he's wearing.  But I digress.  The owner told me that Jamal was playing in Seattle that night, and if I went at the right place and time, I could get a table without a cover.  Serendipity?  Yup.  I went with a friend, and we sat 10 feet from Jamal as he killed it all night, Jamal style, which meant that he was wound tighter than a python around its prey.  Every song ended with him looking up at the audience and giving a tight "Yeah!".  Fantastic evening.
The record store eventually closed.  Sad day: https://www.seattletimes.com/business/jazz-fans-lament-record-stores-closing/

Jamal died two days ago, still playing piano in his 90's.  There's a nice New York Times article about him if you can read it (Google it, or just ask ChatGPT to tell you about Jamal) -- fortunately, my sister subscribes and gifted it to me, but if you don't read the NYT too much, you can probably get it for free.

Jamal forged his own unique style in jazz, featuring sparseness, restraint, and often silence.  It's a true departure from what was standard at the time, and when it works, it really works, in my opnion.  Here are four Jamal tunes for you to enjoy:

The first is his most famous song -- Poinciana, from 1958, I think.  Jamal's piano is understated, and always comes in at just the right time, playing just the right notes.  Not too many.  Not too few.  All is right with the world.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0e2G32f3IU

The second song is one of my favorites -- the song Autumn Leaves, which is usually set to a dreary string arrangement in elevators.  Or at least in the elevators of my youth.  Jamal's take is much more driving, but ever so sparse.  Who on earth would think to play a song like this?  An absolute joy to listen to in my opinion.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXKmjGHTvMA

The third is from the album I bought in Seattle -- "Stepping Out With A Dream".  Make sure you check out his suit on the album cover.  I don't think I could pull that off.  The song "Handicapper" has some interesting non-standard chord changes and a nice driving rhythm, as Jamal switches to electric keyboards.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMD7qiCSGzk

The fourth is one of sister's favorites, from the 1970's album "The Awakening" -- the jazz Standard "Stolen Moments."  Really nice soloing by Jamal on this one, especially those middle solos with all these dense chords.

Group C: 2021-11-02 Get Ready, Temptations, Rare Earth
Group E: 2023-08-24 Get Ready, Temptations, Rare Earth

How many of y'all have heard of the band, Rare Earth?  Zero?  This was a Detroit-based rock band signed by Motown in the 1970's, who put out some uneven records, but a couple of great songs.  Their drummer was the lead singer, and dude had charisma on his vocals.  I'll give you two links -- the first is "I just want to celebrate", which makes me happy whenever it hits my random play (like today, while walking to class in that 90 degree weather...).  Great groove, great vocals, too good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRVPLPFoJL0

#2 is their first big hit, "Get Ready", which was written by Smokey Robinson for the Temptations, not coincidentally also a Motown group (and far more recognizable and popular than Rare Earth).  I vacillate between Rare Earth's version, which is raw, uneven, and has those great vocals: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-BYnPTQaGQ

And the Temptations, which is far smoother and polished and has more direction to it.  But you don't have to choose, because they're both great: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PV97roslmt0

In a distant third is Smokey Robinson's disco version from 1979, pretty much just a curiosity, but why not?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lrLnyDGOUA

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-11-04 Schumann -- Fast Music

Today's MOTD features some rapid tempo music by the 19th century composer Robert Schumann.  This scherzo to his piano quartet just hit my random play, and I always love it when it does: Fast, delicate, and interesting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ctp7XdXmBA

Schuman wrote some great up-tempo movements -- here's the last movement from his first Violin Sonata, which is similar to that Scherzo in its breathlessness.  I have no idea who these performers are, but they slay it -- there are a lot of recordings out there which plod through the movement.  No plodding here (I recommended this recording last semester, too): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGRxmFzuBd8

The first 20 or so published works by Schumann were all solo piano pieces.  This is a "toccata", whose dictionary definition is: "a musical composition for a keyboard instrument designed to exhibit the performer's touch and technique".  I could devote a MOTD to good toccatas (maybe later).  This one by Schumann is a beast, but what's really great is this "my hair is on fire" performance by Emil Gilels in the 1950's.  One of my favorite recordings of all times -- who cares that he misses some notes? It's out-of-control yet in control: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moXLIUXj-no 

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-11-09 Two happy pieces of music: Dvorak 6 and Jessica

Today's MOTD randomly associates two unassociated pieces of music that make me happy.  The first is "Jessica" by the Allman Brothers, basically an extended jam but to me a real "Feel Good" jam.  They had adjusted their drugs / meds/ booze just right for this performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vTOozRAJ8dU

The second is Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's 6th symphony which is a rarity in classical music because it simply makes you happy.  Or, rather, it makes me happy.  I'm partial to a recording by conductor Erich Leinsdorf, but I can't find it on youtube, so this one from Istvan Kertesz 1966 is a nice alternative.  I'm always reluctant to give you a link to a 40-minute piece of music, but here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84qTuNYrzwA

If you want to skip the last movement, which is indeed the happiest of the four, then: https://youtu.be/84qTuNYrzwA?t=1851

------------------------------------------------------------

Group C: 2021-11-11 CS202 and 494 Tchaikovsky 4

Sorry, don't have time to prattle on.  On my random play, Tchaikovsky's 4th Symphony conducted by Eugene Ormandy.  This is my favorite Tchaikovsky symphony, primarily because of the super-dramatic 1st movement, whose last 30 seconds are overwhelmingly intense.  I had never heard Ormandy's performance, but this one is high quality, doing a great job with those last 30 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHaeWgxLs_s

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-11-16 CS202 and 494 Lemminkainen's Return

Here's a fun video of Esa Pekka Salonen conducting the last movement of Sibelius' tone poem "Lamminkainen".  It's the tale of a hero who first drops by a tropical island and gets in trouble because he's a little, uh, promiscuous with the maidens.  Next he sees some enchanted swan on a lake.  That gets him in trouble with someone -- the swan?  the devil?  something like that.  He gets shattered into a million pieces.  Somehow his mother enters the scene and finds all of the pieces and puts him back together.  And then he journeys home (to Finland, I'd reckon) triumphantly.  I have a bit to write about the first movement, but I don't have the time, so just enjoy his triumphant return, and Salonen flopping his hair about: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5AM9ivYoQE

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-11-18 CS202 and 494 Giselle

This is a treat whenever it hits my random play.  Giselle was a ballet written by Adolph Adam, with an absolutely bizarre plot which revolves around a bunch of ghost pixies forcing some dude to dance himself to death.  That's in Act 2.  Act 1, even though it ends with the title character "dying of heatbreak", is charming, upbeat and fun.  When I was slaving away on my expert witness reports and testimony in EMC v Pure (https://fortune.com/2016/03/16/emc-scores-point-in-patent-battle/), I couldn't stop listening to Giselle.  Over and over.  Try it -- you'll get it.  Nice that I could find my recording (Richard Blareau and the Orchestre du Theatre National de L'Opera, Paris from either 1953 or 1960) on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_ln5M0X0ppV9orB6urHABS29zgtndCEYaY

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-11-23 CS202 and 494 Albeniz

These are two similar and fun pieces of piano music by the Spanish composer Isaac Albeniz.  They are similar in their rhythmic repetitions of the right and left hand.  Give them a try -- you'll like them.  The performer in each case is Alicia de Larrocha, long considered the greatest interpreter of Spanish classical piano.  Ms. de Larrocha died in 2009 at the age of 86, and I was lucky enough to have seen her once in Philadelphia (1981-ish, I'm guessing) and once in my home town of Wilmington, Delaware (1983).  She played this piece (prelude to Cantos d'Espana) in the earlier concert, and as usual, Dad had gotten tickets 20 feet away with a perfect view of the keyboard so we could see those three-octave leaps up close: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ls0kd-44ks

You should see the leaps -- here's a video -- as you can see, Mr. Dhamankar is not getting those notes right all the time.  Should make you appreciate de Larrocha's flawless performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X6-xuHvtQNU

The second piece is "El Albaicin", the 7th piece from Albeniz's massive opus "Iberia".  This one is less uniform than the prelude and also a bit more savage.  Here's a studio recording of de Larrocha: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UizObifwxIc 

Plus a video of de Larrocha from 1984: https://youtu.be/eU2McvXB-g0?t=262

And another video, this time from 1969 with truly terrible audio: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmUn_gMAKuw

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2021-11-30 CS202 and 494 HeavyDirty, Janelle Monae Rush-Tom-Sawyer

My son Jeff and his family just visited for thanksgiving, and that means I get to hear his latest music obsession.  Still a lot of Greta Van Fleet, but since I included that last semester, I won't include that here.  Instead, you get an eclectic "heavydirtysoul" from 21 Pilots: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_9Kf0D5BTs

Years ago, Jeff went through his Janelle Monae phase and gave me her "Archandroid" CD.  While it's a bizarre album with a sci-fi backstory, the James-Brown inspired "Tightrope" wears well a decade later: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwnefUaKCbc

Guilty pleasure from Random Play -- "Tom Sawyer" by Rush, from their 1981 album "Moving Pictures".  I was in 9th grade when this came out, and 40+ years later, the opening bars still make me happy. Every time.  As does that guitar solo/bridge in 7/8 time.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auLBLk4ibAk

Here's something that's not wearing well from my Naxos random-play: Stravinsky's Rite of Spring for piano duet.  Who thought that was a good idea?  I love the orchestral version (you've heard it if you watched the original Fantasia), but try listening to this discordant bang-fest while you're trying to write your post-class notes or program your last Lab.  Ecccch.  (On the flip side, these two pianists are quite talented and fun to watch): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gL3Bab34T0

Group B: 2022-02-08 CS360 - Haircut 100 / Thompson Twins
Group C: 2022-02-08 CS302 - Haircut 100 / Thompson Twins
Group E: 2022-10-26 CS302 - Haircut 100 / Thompson Twins

As often is the case, this MOTD comes from random play.  My Sunday was spent putting flooring in our attic so we can store all the crap we own, but that's another story.  My trusty headphones have a 1G SD drive with 1000 random songs from the music library, and on came "Kingsizes" by "Haircut 100": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AsVVexh0SZI -- a breath of fresh air (which was needed as the air in the attic is a nasty mix of mustiness and insulation dust).

I'd put money that you have never heard of Haircut 100, as they made one album, in 1982, which charted in the UK, but not here.  Fortunately, my older sister was in college at the time and liked the album, so at some point in the mid-1980's, I made a cassette of it on one side and the Thompson Twins, whoever they were, on the other side, and it went to college with me.  So this is nostalgia.

Both Haircut 100 and the Thompson Twins are dated, but the music is catchy, upbeat, and guaranteed to get you through your next lab when it's 1:15 AM and you have 45 minutes to avoid that 10-point penalty!  I can guarantee you that I finished the last 1-3 hours of many programming labs with that cassette playing one side, then the other, then one side, then the other.  Over and over.

Group B: 2022-02-15: CS360: Sibelius 1
Group C: 2022-02-15: CS302: Sibelius 1

On Thursday and Friday, the Knoxville Symphony is playing Sibelius' first symphony.  This is firmly in my top 5 of symphonies (Beethoven 7, Tchaikovsky 4, Mahler 1, Brahms 4 and this), and I'll be there, seeing it for the 4th time (once in Nashville, twice in Naples, FL).  As a student, you should be able to get a ticket for $14.  That's the best value you're ever getting for $14.  Better than two BBQ sandwiches from Sweet P's; Better than buying 25% of Pokemon Sword for your Nintendo Switch.  Definitely better than 0.03% of a Tesla.  Hands down.

So it's clear that you should be going to one of these performances.  To prepare you, I'm going to ask for 15 minutes of your life.  Do this in the car or someplace where you don't really need to be paying attention to what you're doing.  Start at the 1:26 mark of this youtube link (it's already starting there): https://youtu.be/X5B0I7TpOWs?t=86 

And listen to that 90 seconds.  Ten times.  After the first two times, you should be able to sing along a little bit, and after the first six, you'll be singing multiple instruments.  Do them all -- strings, trumpets, timpani.  Loud.  Air-conduct, air-timpani, air-trumpet.  LOUD!!!  The full 90 seconds.  Trust me, after 10 times, you'll be hooked, and then you will want to start listening to the rest.  When you do that, start with the main theme's recap @ 6:35: https://youtu.be/X5B0I7TpOWs?t=395 
Again, air-conduct, air-timpani, air-trumpet.  LOUD!!!  You're hooked, right?  Time to go to the concert.  (yes, the whole symphony in 45 minutes, but it's worth it).  See you there on Friday.

Group B: 2022-02-17: CS360: Castelnuovo-Tedesco
Group C: 2022-02-17: CS302: Castelnuovo-Tedesco

This one comes to you via my Naxos random play.  Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco was an Italian composer who came to the US in the 1940's and wrote a ton of movie music, most of which he was not credited for (he was a "staff composer").  I've found most of his classical music boring, because when it hits my random play, I don't remember it.  An exception is his guitar music, which is often very interesting, even if you find guitar recordings to get a bit tedious after a while...  Regardless, this "Pastorale and Rondo" for clarinet, violin, cello and piano did the opposite -- it got an eyebrow raise, and I like it enough to forward to you.  Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMsXuETZd-c

Here's a Castelnuovo-Tedesco guitar piece -- sure looks hard to play to me!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPc-1sayNuY

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-02-22: CS360: The Guess Who - Undun and No Time
Group C: 2022-02-22: CS302: The Guess Who - Undun and No Time

This is a great song, and I always wonder, when I write these, whether it's tired old elevator music to y'all, or something that you've never heard.  Both, maybe?  Whatever -- "Undun" by the Guess Who, released in 1969 (I was three), holds a special place in my heart that it can always replace whatever song is inexorably in my head, and then I'm happy because I'm listening to "Undun".  Baby Shark -- Coco Melon -- thankfully they don't stand a chance, because once I fire up Undun, that's the song in my head.  And as I said, it's a great song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VLMF5GM0Kt8

I don't usually leave with just one song, so #2 comes from random play while ripping down Ailanthus trees, grape vines and pricker bushes today -- "Too Much Time On My Hands", by Styx, from 1981.  Considering I was in high school from 1980-1984, it's safe to say I heard this song 1000 times, and I never listened to the lyrics.  They are friggin hilarious -- all kudos to Styx for writing a catchy song which is really funny.  Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3YG8oq5ZDE

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-02-24: CS360: Black Keys / Frank / Count Basie
Group C: 2022-02-24: CS302: Black Keys / Frank / Count Basie

Whenever the Black Keys come up on my random play, I'm struck be how good their pacing is.  Never rushed -- they hit a groove and stay there.  "Tighten Up" is a good example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EaGNpnvreY0

I'd be remiss not to include my favorite Black Keys song - another masterpiece of pacing, although it's a little faster: "Gold on the Ceiling":  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yCIDkFI7ew

When I think of pacing, I typically think of music from the Big Bands (yes, a long time ago) -- not the fast ones, but not the slow ones.  Those medium tempo songs were the bread and butter of some bands.  Example -- April in Paris by Count Basie, which is also fun because of it's "One More Once" encore endings: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCmcoZktZG4

And finally, here's another example of great relaxed pacing -- "Old Devil Moon" by Frank Sinatra.  Not too fast, not too slow -- just right.  My dad never liked Frank Sinatra ("too much hype"), so I didn't grow up listening to him.  I can't say I agree with dad on this one -- Frank's tone, timing and diction is simply off the charts.  I can only assume that dad had some personal history behind that dislike (kind of like how I've never liked David Bowie, since my high-school girlfriend was all starry-eyed about him.  Yick).  But I digress -- enjoy my favorite Frank song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-THrCLg0uQU

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-03-03: CS360: Rage, Bagpipes, To Be Real
Group C: 2022-03-03: CS302: Rage, Bagpipes, To Be Real
Group E: 2023-09-14: CS302: Rage, Bagpipes, To Be Real

I have 25 minutes to get from CS360 to CS302, so I typically take the long way with the headphones on, playing a random-play SD card from my 19,847-song mp3 collection.  Some groups are good in really small doses, and as such are perfect for random play.  I got a great trio on today's walk:

#1: Down on the street by Rage Against the Machine.  30-minutes of Rage is too much, but 5 minutes is perfect.  Although you first notice the screeching vocals, the guitar and bass are in my opinion the stars of rage.  Angry song == good mood for Dr. Plank: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFVSwpngJps

(I'll give props to my son, who in something like 2001 turned me onto the song Testify by Rage.  Good call.  I'm proud to say that although my middle daughter was 7 at the time, she assimilated, and Testify has always led off her "15 minutes before taking an exam" playlist...): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_zyb-XXWz0

#2: Following Rage on today's random play was bagpipe music by the Simon Fraser University Pipe Band.  Five minutes of bagpipe music is too much, but 2:30, especially when they've added some bass and drums to alleviate the monotony, is just right: https://youtu.be/tLNcwdi1mN4?t=19

#3: And following the bagpipe droning was "To Be Real", by Cheryl Lynn.  This is a belt-fest, and although I try to belt along in my falsetto, you wouldn't want to hear it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fI569nw0YUQ

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-03-10 CS360: League of Crafty Guitarists.
Group C: 2022-03-10 CS302: League of Crafty Guitarists.

The year -- 1989.  Having been a fan of the band King Crimson, I was pleased to discover that their leader, Robert Fripp, had formed an odd acoustic guitar troupe called the "League of Crafty Guitarists," and they were practicing on a farm in Charles Town, West Virginia (not to be confused with Charleston, West Virginia).  When they announced a concert in Philadelphia, Norman and I headed down.  It was a small concert hall, and in walked about 15 nerdy-looking people, with Robert Fripp at the end, holding Ovation guitars.  They sat, nodded left, nodded right, and then hammered out the song Askesis.  They continued relentlessly for 90 minutes or so, interrupted at various times for some woman to drone on singing a solo.  Most definitely worth whatever we paid for it, and the $15 cassette, "Get Crafy I" was also worth the money.  This was before the web, so information and music did not flow as easily then.  You can get whatever you want from youtube now.

Askesis, from "Get Crafty I": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc2BxjqBbv0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-03-22 CS360: Bach Brandenburg 1
Group C: 2022-03-22 CS302: Bach Brandenburg 1

One of Bach's six Brandenburg Concertos just hit my random play.  These are classic pieces for chamber orchestra that are relatively famous and easy on the ears.  My favorite movement is the Menuetto/Trio/Polacca, which is the last movement of the first concerto.  Enjoy when you don't need to think about the music too much:

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-03-24 CS360: Average White Band, Rufus, Chaka
Group C: 2022-03-24 CS302: Average White Band, Rufus, Chaka

On my random play while walking to class was some Rufus.  Talk about band that when they got it right, got it 100% right.  Here's their most popular song, "Tell Me Something Good", which is a good singalaong for your falsetto: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cm_cFzVAoo8

One of my other favorites, "What am I Missing" shows how lead singer Chaka Khan knows how to hold a groove interspersed with some wailing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u43FID4aLTE

And no mentioning of Chaka Khan would be worthwhile without her solo smash hit "I Feel For You" in 1984 (the year I graduated from high school....): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YW0sxgYAmLM

Also on my random play was "School Boy Crush", by another 70's band, "Average White Band".  Talk about pacing -- it doesn't get better than this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Vf0KwuCrvY

And of course any mention of Average White Band wouldn't be worthwhile without including their instrumental hit, "Pick up the Pieces" -- too good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUX_Il6OdJM

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-03-29 CS360: Hector Berlioz
Group C: 2022-03-29 CS302: Hector Berlioz

This was suggested to me by a student, so I'll go with it.  The suggestion was "Symphonie Fantastique" by French composer Hector Berlioz.  This is a really colorful piece of music which is alway a pleasure to listen to.  I won't include the whole thing, but just the last movement -- "Dream of a Witches' Sabbath", which, despite the ominous title, is pretty upbeat, if you ask me, with a lot of rhythmic shifts.  Here's a video of Leonard Bernstein conducting.  I once read a quote to the effect of "Lenny looks like he won the conducting job in a raffle," which still cracks me up whenever I see videos of Bernstein.  He was an excellent conductor: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cao6WyF-61s

You can find the other movements with Lenny by doing "berlioz symphonie fantastique bernstein" in Youtube.  I doubt I really needed to tell you that. 

Another interesting Berlioz piece is "Harold in Italy", written for Viola and Orchestra.  Pieces showcasing the viola are pretty rare, and this one showcases it well.  Here's a link to a great instrumentalist -- William Primrose, and a great conductor -- Serge Koussevitzky.  Here's the first movement.  It's slow going in the beginning, but when it picks up (about 6:45), it starts to become infectious.  I especially like the unexpected kind of rhythmic and tonic shift at (11:17-11:40).  Listen a few times.  It's worth it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhh0wBazHzQ

------------------------------------------------------------
Group B: 2022-03-31 CS360: Lowdown by Chicago
Group C: 2022-03-31 CS302: Lowdown by Chicago

The band, Chicago, which was 1970s-1980's gets some bad press, because they went from a guitar-and-horns oriented band with some pop hooks, to complete "bubble-gum" pop.  But their early albums contained some fresh and in some instances hard-hitting music.  Their first two albums had a slew of songs that became hits, but their third album fell flat.  The song "Lowdown" came up on my random play early this week, and I had to listen multiple times -- it has everything one likes: groove, good bass, great organ, great vocal harmonies, nice brass section and a really good guitar solo.  But somehow, it's not a great song.  I had forgotten about it.  Part of it is that I think the lyrics are sketchy and negative, even though the music is positive, but I don't know, I still feel like it should be a better song than it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d69NAdakdMU

A similar song from the same album is "Free".  Same thing: great bass, brass, vocals, but somehow a forgotten song.  See what you think: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXnWRw7Gff4

Group B: 2022-04-05 CS360: Bruno Mars
Group C: 2022-04-05 CS302: Bruno Mars

On this morning's random play -- Treasure by Bruno Mars.  An upbeat Bruno Mars song on the random play is always, well, a treasure.  One thing about Bruno is that he keeps it simple -- money, sex, dancing -- that's about it.  You don't have to tax yourself listening to Bruno Mars, like you do, say, King Crimson or Stravinsky, and when you're walking to class, thinking about the Dup() system call and the Ford-Fulkerson network flow algorithm, a non-taxing song or two fits the bill.  Treasure: https://youtu.be/cy6Arnjp-hQ?t=4

And my favorite Bruno Mars song -- "Perm", where he rhymes "rhythm" with "with him", and "get it" with "twitter".  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftXmvnL0ZOc

Group C: 2022-04-07 CS302: Venus
Group E: 2023-09-05 CS302: Venus

Like most people of my age, the song "Venus" was introduced to me by the band "Bananarama".  More on that later.  The original was a one-hit-wonder song by the band, "The Shocking Blue", and let's face it -- it's a great song.  Catchy.  Singalong.  "You Got It".  Here's an official video, which is notable for a lot of things -- the vocalist really seems not to care.  At all.  Drugged?  Shell of a human?  I'll never know, because I won't probe into it, but I can tell you that if I were singing "Venus", I'd be a bit more animated.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LhkyyCvUHk

Other fun things -- although there's a keyboard that plays a pretty big role in the music, there's no keyboard in the video.  In fact, when there's a break with just the keyboard, they all stand there doing nothing.  And finally, one the great parts of the song is at 1:23, where someone, certainly no one in the video gives a great "Wow!"  Pretty funny.  Regardless, it's a great song

As I mentioned above, I was introduced to the song by "Bananarama", which made a cover in 1986 that became a hit while I was in college, and, well, you just have to watch the video -- quite dated, but one of the things that I like is that unlike that nearly comatose singer from Shocking Blue, everyone in this video is having an extremely good time!  Even though it's not the original, this is still a great song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4-1ASpdT1Y

Here's a bonus -- back in the early 2000's, I was introduced to the Shocking Blue version of Venus, and on the same "Sounds of the 70's" collection was "Green Eyed Lady", another one-hit wonder, this time by the band "Sugarloaf".  Evidently the main riff came from a practice lesson in a book of guitar lessons.  Whatever, this band coupled it with organ and if you've never heard it before, you should hear it now: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYbmls7c8EM

Group B: 2022-04-12 CS360: Preston Reed
Group C: 2022-04-12 CS302: Preston Reed

When you become a parent, your time becomes hostage to your kids' activities.  As you gain experience, you'll start to understand that some activities are tolerable, and some are, well, not.  In the "tolerable" category, we have:

- T-Ball: They are so friggin cute and it's limited to an hour.
- Upward Basketball: Under an hour, your kid plays regardless of talent, and you may get a nice song at halftime.

On the flip side, we have:

- AYSO soccer tournament: Three games, at 9:00, 12:00 and 3:00, over an hour from your house.
- Swim Meet: Three hours and you can't bring your laptop for fear of it getting wet.
- Dance Recital: The worst.  3+ hours, of which your kid is dancing for what, 3 minutes, and they don't tell you when.

Why is this in a "Music of the Day" post?  Well, while hostage at a dance recital, one of the older groups did a dance routine called "Crystal Silence", which, like most of the dance routines, was three minutes I'll never get back, but the music was by Preston Reed.  Who is this Preston Reed?  Well, he's an acoustic guitarist, who likes to play by hammering / pulling with both hands on the guitar -- quite percussive and also quite interesting.  So something good comes from something mind-numbing.  Perhaps there's a lesson in there, but I won't admit it.  Here are three Preston Reed songs that you get to see him play.  I like the one where he has to move his hair out of the way before he starts...

Group B: 2022-04-19 CS360: A Child Is Born
Group C: 2022-04-19 CS302: A Child Is Born

It has been a delightful Sunday.  My wife and I spent the day at the RBC Heritage golf tournament in Hilton Head -- great weather plus a playoff to end the tournament (Jordan Spieth beat Patrick Cantlay, in case you care). When we got back to the car, my wife suggested to google "Waterfront Restaurants" to end the evening, and google suggested "ELA's", overlooking Shelter Cove Harbor, and as the sun set, the jazz-playing piano dude played "A Child Is Born".  Perfect.

My go to on this song is pianist Oscar Peterson in a really nice solo performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eqFOXHMxwfA

The original was by Thad Jones, which I think is really nice until the full orchestra comes in.  That rarely does it for me.  It's not bad; I just think that this song is better in a more intimate setting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-M2ADUgffFE

This piece is also in the Bill Evans wheelhouse, but I acknowledge at this point that even I don't want to listen to this three times in a row.  It's better on random play: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsQjXYWmsog

The exception to the "don't like orchestra with jazz" rule returns to Oscar Peterson, playing Dizzy Gillespie's song, "Con Alma", and as it happens, I can't find the recording I like on Youtube -- from the album "Verve Return Engagement".  So, instead, I'll just include a trio recording, which captures the vibe of the song, but not the essence of the big band version of this.  If I could post it legally, I would.  For now, you'll just have to buy the vinyl on ebay...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DG3rwcoeYvE

Group B: 2022-04-21 CS360: Karn Evil 9
Group C: 2022-04-21 CS302: Karn Evil 9
Group E: 2024-01-30 CS302: Karn Evil 9

This one is a guilty pleasure for sure.  1973.  Emerson, Lake and Palmer were a "power" trio: Keyboards, Guitar/Bass, Percussion, set in the time when synthesizers were for the nerdy, and record companies were willing to take fliers on 10+ minute songs.  Before I scare you off with a 30+ minute assault, I'll include their three-minute album starter, the traditional British hymn, "Jerusalem", which gets me going every time I hear it!  It was banned by the BBC for airplay -- why?  Too good?  That's the only thing I can come up with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9TbiIEpZJ8

The remaining link is a 30+ minute showstopper named "Karn Evil 9".  This is an epic in three parts mostly centered around a combination of Keith Emerson's virtuoso keyboard and relentlessly driving rhythms.  To be fair, I have no idea what part 1 is about -- grandiose, bombastic, jaggedy, odd-lyrically -- it's great, and I what I like most about it is you can hear that Emerson, Lake and Palmer really enjoyed playing at that level of intensity and difficulty.  Too much fun.

Part 2 is an instrumental interlude -- "jazzy" maybe, but not improvised, again showing off Emerson's keyboard chops.  It has an eerily murky middle section before the beginning part repeats.

And part 3 is some epic battle or other between man and a computer.  1973, remember?  I doubt that the Commodore 64 was too well poised to take over mankind in 1973, but whatever, just play along with the bombacity and pomposity, and that kitschy computer-programmed ending that oscillates between the left and right speakers.  How could it not?  Whew.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLS0Med0s6E

Group B: 2022-04-26 CS360: Brahms PC 1
Group C: 2022-04-26 CS302: Brahms PC 1

Since it hit my random play today, and I'm lacking inspiration, why not introduce you to Brahms' first piano concerto.  First off, it's way too long, and I don't expect you to listen to it too intently.  But I'll give you some things to pay attention to.  The first thing is the first minute -- no piano, mind you, but if ever there was a time for air timpani or air violin, this is it.  My go-to recording is John Ogdon in 1969: Listen to the first minute.  Good, isn't it?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yzs2ggQFx9I

Skip ten minutes -- there's introspection there between minutes 1 and 10 and who has time for that.  Here you go: https://youtu.be/Yzs2ggQFx9I?t=605

You'll note you're back at that initial orchestral theme, but now we've got some thundering octaves  and good interplay between the orchestra and piano.  Things slow down after a minute, but don't skip, because we're building to something good.  At 11:54 John starts pounding and throbbing -- then some nice runs (12:28) and finally the buildup to pounding chords and orchestra and (12:58) AIR TIMPANI!!!!  You'll have to back it up a few times so you can practice and get it right!

You'd think a 20-minute first movement would end impressively, and Brahms tries.  Skip to 19:20 -- https://youtu.be/Yzs2ggQFx9I?t=1161

The octaves are pounding again, especially there at 19:50, but then the pace slows and he meanders.  Really  We've been at this 20 minutes?  Back to focus at 20:19 -- it's a nice ending, but I always want it to be bigger!  You do get to close with some more air timpani.  

Don't bother with the rest.  It's not worth it....

Group B: 2022-04-28 CS360: Sibelius 5
Group C: 2022-04-28 CS302: Sibelius 5
Group D: 2023-03-07 CS202: Sibelius 5
Group E: 2023-03-07 CS360: Sibelius 5

Some of you may have gotten this in 302 last year.  Sorry.  However, the repetition is because the Knoxville Symphony is playing Sibelius' 5th symphony at the end of the month (the 23rd and 24th), so I'm resurrecting my text on this work.  The cliff notes are that you should go if you can -- it's a very powerful, soaring and inspiring piece of music.  I hope the good Mr. Demirjian (the conductor) can make me like the ending.  We'll see.  Anyway, as a student, you can get any ticket for $17.  If you buy at the box office and not online, you can avoid the extortian fee.  I highly recommend it!

The title of this musing is "Opportunity Lost", which for today applies to Jean Sibelius' fifth symphony.  If you have the full 35 minutes, give the whole thing a listen.  The youtube linker spent way too much time on the video montage and I don't think it really adds anything, but I'm sure he/she will appreciate the clicks.  Herbert von gives a great rendition of this symphony:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAFouzo3ZHQ

The first movement is fantastic, both majestic and bleak, morphing into a scherzo with a perfect ending.  The second movement is a throwaway -- just my opinion.  Ok, but nothing to write home about.

But I'm not highlighting either of those movements.  It's the third movement.   Here's a direct link to the start.  If you're short on time, start here: https://youtu.be/FAFouzo3ZHQ?t=1394

It begins agitatedly with the strings, but (at 24:23) it leads to one of the best orchestral passages you'll ever hear.  It's kind of a pity that Sibelius said it was inspired by swans flying, (as you see, of course, in the video montage), because that's limiting, to me.  It's better than swans.  It's stupdenous.

So why oppportunity lost?  Well, the good passage ends after a minute and a half, and the rest of the symphony simply can't live up to that great moment.  Instead, it meanders around then builds the drama to what you'd hope will be a rousing conclusion.  You're ready for it!  But instead it ends on these five moronic chords played super-slow.  I've seen many written paean's (look it up) to this ending ("the five chords that shook the world", blah blah blah), and for the life of me I don't understand.  It pisses me off every time I hear it (including now, as I write this).  Were I rich and around when Sibelius wrote this (1915), I would have shoveled him some money to write a better ending.  But that wasn't up to me... Take a listen and see which side you're on.  (If you're short on time, here's a direct link to the last minute): https://youtu.be/FAFouzo3ZHQ?t=1881

Group B: 2022-05-05 CS360: Raconteurs, Ricky Scaggs, Nitty Gritty Old Valley Road
Group C: 2022-05-05 CS302: Raconteurs, Ricky Scaggs, Nitty Gritty Old Valley Road

The song "Old Enough" by the Raconteurs hit my random play yesterday, and I had no idea what this song was, who sang it, or why it was on my random play.  As it turns out, my son gave me the CD back in 2009 or so, and it has taken me a few years to appreciate it...  Regardless, I'm always glad to hear a new song that captivates me in a way or two and this one has done that.  In case you've never heard it, here's the "Official Video", which I hate to say, made me like the song less.  So if you think you're like me, just listen and don't bother watching:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXfpre4w540

As I looked for it on youtube, I saw a version featuring Ricky Scaggs and Ashley Monroe with a more country vibe, but still a good good and worth a listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qahZ-whM6o

It made me think of "well-known musicians collaborate on a good song," so I'll finish the semester with my favorite in that genre, which is Bruce Hornsby playing with the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on his upbeat-song-with-depressing-lyrics, "The Valley Road".  Unlike the videos above, this is a fun vidoe to watch, largely because the musicians are so talented.  With their floofy hair and meticulously groomed mustaches, I don't feel that they are very Nitty or Gritty, but they play this song impeccably: https://youtu.be/CzkOvA_mHg8?t=291

I've enjoyed sharing music with you this semester - I hope you've discovered a gem or two...

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-08-25 CS494: Foreigner

I flew back from Florida yesterday, and I had the song "Feels Like the First Time" by Foreigner going through my head.  I'm not sure why -- maybe it was background music somewhere.  I just checked youtube and you get an "official" video from 1977 -- window into another era.  Since I'm so much older than y'all, I never know whether you (a) have never heard songs like this, (b) have heard them a million times as elevator music, (c) have heard them enough as they are familiar, but not very.  Let me know.  Maybe in your grappling hook assignment.  Whatever -- what I like about Foreigner's songs is that they are easy to sing -- the lyrics match the music flawlessly.  I'm not sure if it's a gift of songwriting or a gift of singing, but regardless -- it's a gift.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-08-30 CS494: Frank

Today's MOTD comes from Daniel Mishler, who was the first student to define the bug in the "Ransom Note" leetcode problem.  From Daniel: "I think the song of the day is Day in, Day out - Sinatra's version. I love how the brass can turn the intensity up and down on a dime."  No complaint here -- a great Frank song.  https://youtu.be/MXW_jN6PIcY

For those of you who didn't have me last semester, here's my prose on my favorite Frank Song -- "Old Devil Moon":  Here's another example of great relaxed pacing -- "Old Devil Moon" by Frank Sinatra.  Not too fast, not too slow -- just right.  My dad never liked Frank Sinatra ("too much hype"), so I didn't grow up listening to him.  I can't say I agree with dad on this one -- Frank's tone, timing and diction is simply off the charts.  I can only assume that dad had some personal history behind that dislike (kind of like how I've never liked David Bowie, since my high-school girlfriend was all starry-eyed about him.  Yick).  But I digress -- enjoy my favorite Frank song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-THrCLg0uQU

And here's a guilty pleasure -- "The Continental", which is a really stupid song from a Fred Astaire movie, but here it showcases everything great about Frank.  Try a singalong after you've heard it a few times -- you won't be disappointed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zK3Z1wZxZic

Frank came to Yale to give a talk while I was an undergrad, and a bunch of my friends were really excited to go.  Me -- I was still under the "too much hype" influence, so I skipped it.  Pity -- wish I had been there...

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-09-01 CS494: Grieg

Today's recommendation comes from Lily Sharpe, who was the second student to spot the "Ransom Note" bug.  She says one of her favorites is "Wedding Day at Troldhaugen" by Norwegian composer Edvard Grieg.  This is one of Grieg's many "Lyric Pieces" that he wrote throughout his life, and Lily's youtube link is to a really nice performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqxEFrpDtE0

Grieg is most well known for his "Peer Gynt" suite.  The first and last parts of the suite -- "Morning Mood" and "Hall of the Mountain King" have been featured in many, many, many cartoons, video games and movies, so you'll probably recognize them.  Here are links to videos where you can see conductor Thomas Dausgaard over-emote while conducting the Seattle Symphony:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMs0rNtBZJk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nMUr8Rt2AI

Grieg specialized in writing smaller pieces, but he wrote a few really good larger works.  I'll recommend his Piano Concerto, in this great 1961 performance by Julius Katchen with the Israel Philharmonic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLcvUVB50Vw

And his 3rd Violin Sonata, in an epic 1928 performance by two towering figures of their instruments: Fritz Kreisler on violin and Sergei Rachmaninoff (he of the Statue in the World's Fair Park) on piano. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9JNzi4yhik

(Include the story about Billy Jones and Greg Edwards).


------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-09-06 CS494: Rach 2 - Grimaud, Richter

One of the great perks of being at UT is that you have free access to the Naxos Classical Streaming Library.  If you love classical music, you can pretty much listen to something new every day.  Yesterday, I listened to an album of the French pianist Helene Grimaud playing Rachmaninoff's second piano concerto.  As it is probably the world's most famous piano concerto, I heave heard it hundreds of times, but this recording grabbed my attention -- a great combination of dynamics, clarity and emotion.  My go-to recording has always been Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter, but this one rivals it.

Give it a listen -- you can log into Naxos at https://libguides.utk.edu/databases/544, then paste 190295000264 into the search bar.

Or listen on youtube at www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GLSHtDzg5o

There is video of Ms. Grimaud playing the concerto at this youtube link, but I don't think the performance is as exceptional as the other one: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uyz0kuw4dv8

There are a lot of recordings of Richter playing the Rachmaninoff, but my favorite is this one from 1959.  He takes the opening passage a little slow, but unlike most recordings, you don't lose the piano in it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygfLNLs2IBU

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-09-22 CS494: Yes - And You And I

This song "And You And I" by the 1970's prog-rock group Yes hit my random play on the walk to Min Kao, and I am struct by what a well-crafted song it is.  It starts ethereally with harmonics on the guitar, which segues to a pensive guitar theme, which then segues into a great 12-string chord sequence and the typically impenetrable lyrics that come from Yes.  Whatever, it's definitely Yes at its finest (and there are a lot of fine moments with Yes).  Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwpB6b6mhUM

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-09-27: CS494: Haydn     
Group E: 2022-10-31: CS302: Haydn     

I'm somewhat irrational with my musical tastes, and nowhere is this more clear than fact that I like Haydn, but I don't like Mozart, even though they are usually lumped together as the main composers from the "Classical" era.  When I hear Mozart, I always wish I were elsewhere not listening to Mozart.  Whereas I often find Haydn's music fun and enjoyable.  Here are three examples:

1. Sviatoslav Richter plays Haydn's 62nd sonata in 1967.  When you've written 62 sonatas, that may be a sign that you have written enough sonatas.  But this one embodies what I like about Haydn's sonatas: Engaging, upbeat, fun -- all of the above.  To find this on Naxos, look up "ICAC5004".  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pe35509xWdU

2. Mikita Magaloff plays Haydn's 58'th sonata in 1960.  I start you in the second movement because it's more fun.  Magaloff is really good with clarity and elegance, but you can tell he enjoys playing this. The final movement to Haydn's sonatas are often Rondos, which means they keep present a main section, and then alternate it with other sections, often with some small changes.  This is a classic rondo with a great melody and some happy chords in the main section.  Enjoy: https://youtu.be/mWTDUzCQzKY?t=369

3. John Browning plays Haydn's 59th sonata in 1958.  As with Magaloff, you can tell that Browning likes playing this sonata, which is a good thing, because I like listening to it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGNdibMfS8c

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-09-29: CS494: Earth, Wind & Fire plus Gina Bachauer

Here are two artists related only by the fact that I listened to them both on the same day:

#1: Earth, Wind & Fire.  Earth, Wind and Fire were great as they were one of the first groups to present as a large, energetic and glamorous throng of musicians on stage.  Today's EWF songs compose one of my favorites duos from their 1977 album "All 'n All" -- "Magic Mind", which is just all energy and groove, with some virtuoso horn licks.  On the album, it is followed instantly by "Runnin", which is more energy and groove and great bass playing.  The return from the bridge (starting at 1:22) is just fantastic.

Links: 

Here's the album version of Magic Mind: Studio https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0nCEeTKw1hQ

Here's a live version from 1979 which can't be missed.  I wish I had been older than 13 years old, so I could have seen this in person: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhdNORt0VWs

Runnin: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro8K8qDsYTs

#2: Gina Bachauer.  I probably was 13 years old when dad took me to Philadelphia to see Gina Bachauer in concert.  He wouldn't have liked Earth, Wind and Fire.  He claimed that she was the best female pianist in the world.  I had no basis to disagree with dad, but she was clearly the best pianist I had ever seen.  She played Maurice Ravel's exceedingly difficult "Gaspard de la Nuit", and it was thrilling.  An album of hers hit my Naxos random play today (search for 00028948443703), so I thought I'd share:

Here's "Scarbo" from Gaspard de la Nuit.  Dad translated this as "the devil", which I don't think it technically correct, but whatever -- it always added to the allure of the piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcFHWhwuySQ

Here's a video of Bachauer playing the 3rd movement of Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto - gotta love how resolute her playing is, and how she likes to do those big gestures with her hands and arms -- good and dramatic!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyBlE_4Hp5Q

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-10-11: CS494: Appassionata 

When I work, I listen to random classical music from UT's subscription to the Naxos Music Library.  It's a great perk of the University.  I was working Saturday morning, and the album was the "9th Hamamatsu International Piano Competition", held in 2015.  When I hear a piece of music that I've heard a bazillion times, I tend to check out, so when I hear a recording that makes me pay attention, that's something.  The piece is Beethoven's "Appassionata", which is one of my favorite pieces of music in any genre.  If you want to know why Beethoven is so great, and you don't want to slog through 75 minutes of his 9th symphony, this piece does it.  It is savage, and its 3rd movement maintains the intensity throughout its 8 or so minutes, ending with this fantastic run down the keyboard to three ferocious ending chords.

A great performance of the Appassionata combines the savagery with clarity of performance.  It's not an easy task, and I think pianists have to balance getting carried away with too much restraint.  Back when I played Prokofiev's 7th piano sonata, I tried to match the intensity of Sviatoslav Richter's performance, and I found that I couldn't.  I just didn't have it in me, even though I wanted to.  So it's not as easy as you think.  So here are three 3rd movements of the Appassionata to chew on:

1. Lazar Berman, 1976.  In 1976, Berman was kind of a legend -- a Soviet pianist who only made recordings in Russia. This was in the middle of the Cold War, so those recordings were hard to come by.  This recording came from a major record label, so dad bought is instantly.  The recording here is from the vinyl and is a little harsh, but it captures the ferocity combined with crystal clear playing.  The ending is simply too much:

2. Walter Gieseking, 1939.  This is the recording that I grew up on, before I heard Berman's.  Holy crap does he play it fast.  Some may say too fast.  It kinda ruined me for other recordings of the Appassionata, because no one plays it this fast, but man, it's clear and it's savage.  The Berman recording was the first one to make me appreciate someone playing it slower than this.  Gieseking does get carried away a little by the ending, but after ripping through the first 6-7 minutes like that, I'd be getting carried away too:

3. Alexei Melnikov, 2015/2018.  I can't find the Hamamatsu recording on youtube, so if you're on Naxos (https://libguides.utk.edu/databases/544), search ALCD-7201-7202.  He's into it and it shows.  I did find a studio recording from 2018 on youtube, and while it's very good, it doesn't match the intensity of the live performance:

Group C: 2022-10-18 CS494 - Steven Wilson & Porcupine Tree
Group D: 2023-01-26
Group E: 2023-01-26

This is the other song that has been dominating my playlists.  It hit my random-play in mid-October, and I don't think I had heard it before.  That happens with older albums that I bought, back when I bought albums, and then put all of the songs into my music library without listening to them.  This one caught my attention in October, and I've probably listened to it 200 times since.  It's a song called "Luminol" by the british musician Stephen Wilson.  Wilson is a busy musician, heading two bands, Porcupine Tree and No-Man, as well as his own solo albums.  I go back and forth with Wilson's music, as at times it has some great grooves with driving bass and nice guitars, and then at other times it's pretty dreary.  Luminol fits the former category - I really like the bass and drums, and in the video you can tell the bass and drum players are really enjoying playing the song.  With Wilson and the guitarist, it's less clear, but whatever.  I'm still addicted.

And here's one of my favorites from Porcupine Tree -- the song that introduced me to Steven Wilson -- "Blackest Eyes": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh9osYZNilU

Group C: 2022-11-01 CS494 John Carmichael

It's not often that I learn of a new classical composer whom I like, and it's even less often that said composer hasn't been dead for 50+ years.  My Naxos random play took me to piano and chamber music by John Carmichael: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmichael_(composer)

Usually when you get a link to a new and relatively recent composer, it's some new-agy etherial (and boring) composition with a name like "Dawn Reflections", or some unlistenable discordant composition with a name like "Cat Claws On Slate Inside a Turbine."  I usually give them 30 seconds before moving on, just in case I get something like I got with Carmichael -- very listenable, refreshing and interesting.  Give it a try: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvV5-H3Ml74&list=OLAK5uy_n2m4Vekb4ak_ANHmqTPKG_dvt1dgnCD3g

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-11-03 CS494 Holst Planets + 5/4 time

Today's MOTD comes from our class visitor Ping Wang, who suggested "Mars, Bringer of War", from the Planets by Gustav Holst.  Written during the first world war, this piece brought headbanging in classical music to a new level.  It's been covered by countless rock bands, because it is, well, to put it technically, bad-ass.  I don't have a favorite performance -- I like this because it's live, and the conductor is clearly into it:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXOanvv4plU 

Mars is in 5/4 time (just count with the main beats, and you see that the emphasis repeats every five beats), which means I'd be remiss not to point out other great songs in 5/4.  This list is by no means exhaustive, but just what comes to mind.  I always put Jethro Tull's "Living in the Past" (1969) on the top of the list, because it's catchy, and they never revert to 4/4 time for a break: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tn9IyFLDtjk 

Led Zeppelin's "Four Sticks" is a nice driving 5/4, but it gets docked for reverting to 6/8 at times: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My1PH6H1Qpo 

More famous 5/4 pieces are the second movement of Tchaikovsky's sixth symphony (an earlier MOTD), and "Take 5", written in 1959 by Paul Desmond, recorded by the Dave Brubeck Quartet (Desmond was the saxophonist): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmDDOFXSgAs 

Perhaps the most famous 5/4 song of all time: The main theme of the TV show "Mission Impossible", by Lalo Schifrin.  A truly irresistible theme.  Listen a bit and you'll realize it's a simple 12-bar blues, just in 5/4 time with a great theme: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O07WucFwdq8 

I have an album from 1990 of Bernard Herrmann conducting the San Diego Symphony, and the last track is Mission Impossible.  There's nothing too notable about it except the second part of the piano solo is all block chords, and it's absolutely perfect.  Unfortunately, I can't find it on youtube, and I can't post it, so if you're truly interested, buy the CD on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Hitchcock-Master-Mayhem-Franz-Waxman/dp/B000000C8A 

Barring that, it's fun to watch Schifrin playing this with an orchestra: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5SYHcD_CYA 

Finally, I'll include one of my favorite etudes from the Soviet composer Alexander Scribin (Opus 42, #8 - Composed in 1903).  While it's in four-four time, the note groupings in the right hand are all in 5, which accounts for the constant flow of the melody.  Here's a nice recording by Garrick Ohlsson: https://youtu.be/Hf4EIJB4DGc?t=789 

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-11-08 - War (CS494)

As usual, today's MOTD comes from my headphone-random-play as I walk into the office.  War was a group in the late 60's early 70's from Long Beach California.  Their sound is dated, but also pretty iconic and eclectic, making good use of harmonicas, organs, cow bells, etc. So here are a few selections:

1. "All Day Music" - how can you not feel good after vibing through this song.  It's the one that came up on the random play, and it made me happy for, well, at least the four minutes that it was on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coHUt4si8Oo

2. "Low Rider" - War's best known song for good reason.  Great cowbell.  https://youtu.be/BsrqKE1iqqo?t=26

3. "Summer" - I think "All Day Music" does a better job with its vibe, but this one is up there with the similar vibe: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLNIT0PDNQ

4. "Me and Baby Brother" -- Another groove, which I wouldn't include except for that bass line that you first hear at 45 seconds.  Makes it totally worth listening to all of that repetition.

Group C: 2022-11-10 - Kapustin Etudes
Group E: 2024-02-16 - Kapustin Etudes

This was one of those Naxos random play revelations that I got to experience for the first time in November, 2022.  The album was one of "virtuoso piano etudes", that started nicely, but got really discordant to the point where I'm guessing most listeners bailed.  The number is BC96005 if you have Naxos.  Fortunately, I didn't bail -- I just kept skipping the irritating stuff, and got to etudes from Soviet composer Nikolai Kapustin.  Whoa!  Soviet dude likes jazz but composes classical, and man does it work.  I have a ton of links below -- the links from Sukyeon Kim and Yuja Wang are to live performances which are fun to watch.  I also have Kapustin playing the ones that Kim doesn't play, and links to studio recordings from Kim and Wang that are (in my opinion) better than the live ones.  Plus Shan-shan Sun who seems a little unhinged playing #3.  This is good stuff, and I'm really glad I stumbled upon them.  At my age, we're getting to the point where I can't assume I'm going to hear all the good music there is to hear, so I appreciate it when I hear something new that is this good -- enjoy!

Group C: 2022-11-15 CS494.  Scriabin's Fantasy
Group E: 2023-09-19 CS494.  Scriabin

Soviet composer Alexander Scriabin was a trip.  He was a very talanted composer, able to evoke powerful moods with relatively simple music.  Like Chopin, he composed almost exclusively for the piano, and his output has great variety.  One nice thing about Scriabin is that a lot of his music is pretty easy to play, so if you're in the mood, pick up his Opus 11 Preludes and have at it.

Anecdote #1 about Scriabin -- I'm not sure who the musician was, but he relayed a story where he and Scriabin hung out for a day together, and the next day, Scriabin handed him a piece of music, saying, "This is exactly how our afternoon together felt yesterday," and evidently he nailed it.  Wish I knew what that piece was.

Anecdote #2 about Scriabin -- I read a great story by conductor Serge Koussevitzky, which I'm going to paraphrase and probably butcher, so take it with a grain of salt.  As he moved on in his life, Scriabin became more of a mystic, and his music became pretty odd.  As he started his mystic phase, he wrote a large-scale orchestral piece called the "Poem of Ecstasy", which Koussevitzky conducted in Russia.  The quote is something like the following, "Scriabin was convinced that his music was so emotionally powerful, that at the end of the piece, the audience would be glued to their seats, unable to move, spellbound by the music, and suffocated in ecstasy.  In reality, we all went to the restaurant.  Including Scriabin."  

This link is my favorite Scriabin piece, his Opus 28 Fantasy for piano.  He had procured a teaching post at the Moscow Conservatory, and this is one of the pieces that he wrote there.  This is before his days as a mystic.  Lyrical, brooding, powerful, layered -- Lazar Berman gives it a good reading (he recorded the piece a lot): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxeGu-RKC-Q

#2 is a fantastic, and very difficult Etude (French for "Study") -- Opus 42, #5, and although you have to sit through 10 seconds of silence while Andrei Gavrilov gets himself mentally prepared, it's worth the wait to watch him play it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfJPNABU54Y

#3 is another Etude, this time from Scriabin's "early" period, Opus 8, #5.  Good lush melodies and harmonies, given a great reading by Sviatoslav Richter: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Pc0i5HO9j4

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-11-23 CS494.  Santana
Group E: 2023-10-03 CS302.  Santana

I work with music on at all times.  I suspect most of you are the same way.  Often I'm absorbed in my work and don't really pay attention to the music -- much of the time I've heard it so many times, it's simply background.  However, there are a few pieces of music which, when they come up on my random-play, make me stop and listen.  Beethoven's 7th symphony.  Brahms' 4th symphony.  Probably 15 other classical pieces.  There aren't as many rock songs that do that for me, but here's one that got me yesterday, and always gets me -- it's the first four songs from the album "Moonflower" by Santana -- they blend together: Dawn/Go Within/Carnaval/Let the Children Play/Jugando.  It's a mix of studio and live recordings, going from serene to spirited to driving to really driving.  When Carlos' guitar enters on "Let the Children Play", it's a moment.  A great moment.  One that you shouldn't miss.  The band "Santana" is enigmatic -- pretty much whatever group Carlos Santana was playing in at the moment -- at this point in 1977, it was a magical collection.  Keep this link handy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEeqRcQcaqc

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-12-01. Khachaturian's Piano Concerto & Sabre Dance

Today's MOTD features the Armenian composer Aram Khachaturian.  I had his piano concerto hit my random play yesterday, but I'll talk about that later.  Since y'all said today that you like shorter pieces of classical music (and I don't blame you), I'll link you to Khachaturian's most famous piece -- the Sabre Dance.  You've heard it before, or if you haven't, click on this link, and you'll be happy that you did -- it's energetic, upbeat and fun.  Definitely in the "top 10 classical pieces under 5 minutes." 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUQHGpxrz-8Links to an external site.


Khachaturian's piano concerto is a top four piano concerto for me (Rachmaninoff 3, Rachmaninoff 2, Tchaikovsky 1, and Khachaturian).  The story is that Khachaturian showed Prokofiev a draft of the concerto, and Prokofiev told him that he should take all of the ideas from the concerto and write 15 different pieces of music.  Don't blow it all on one piece.  I don't think Khachaturian took the advice, because the ideas flow freely and all over the place -- great piano passages; great interplay with piano and orchestra.  And it's easily his best piece of music -- perhaps he should have minded Prokofiev, but then maybe we'd all listen to just one piece by Khachaturian (the sabre dance) instead of two...  The whole thing is 45 minutes, so let me recommend one of three things with this one:

1. Click on this link and kill it when you get bored.  Maybe you'll listen all the way through.  The pianist is American William Kapell who gave the first great performance of this concerto, so it's largely considered "his" concerto (he died tragically in a plane crash at the age of 31):
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEi2C2-5G14Links to an external site.


2. Just listen to the second movement -- its' only 11 minutes, and it's a killer.  I'll give you some highlights and structure: It's organized as AABA -- the A theme is long, slow and haunting.  At the 17:23 mark, it starts over again, but this time the drama is heightened with a great background clarinet line (18:06), and if you pay attention, you'll note that the piano accompaniment is alternating registers with these quiet murky chords in the bass.  At 18:39, the piano plays a really dramatic counter melody that leads to what I call a "set up chord" in the middle of the register, followed by a crash of chords simultaneously in both registers (19:09 and again 19:15 -- it's more subtle here than later in the movement).  I love that part though.  The B section starts at 19:26 -- a good developmental section that builds to this great thunderous line of descending chords (22:14) in the piano while the percussionist starts pounding louder and louder on the cymbal.  YEAH!!!!!  Leading us to the last A section which is now in full force (again with clarinet and "set up" chords).  It dies down to end.  Too good!

3. Click on this link so you can hear a performance that uses a theremin (it's written into the score as optional.  I prefer without, but it is a curiosity if you think that the theremin is a cool instrument (look it up)):

------------------------------------------------------------
Group C: 2022-12-06 Coltrane/Naima

I'll leave you with one of my favorites, the song Naima by John Coltrane.  I'll give you the short story and the long story.  The short story: John Coltrane played the tenor sax, and his playing was lauded for its intensity and virtuosity.  His album, "Giant Steps", in 1959, was notable because the main chord progression on the title song was very difficult to solo over, but of course Coltrane flies over it with both intensity and grace.  Tack #6 on the album is this still, haunting and serene song, Naima, named after Coltrane's wife.  No fireworks, no intensity, but a simple melody over a beautiful chord progression.  It's a memorable song, and if you don't know it, I think you'll like it, so please give it a click: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTMqes6HDqU

Now the longer story -- 1985 maybe?  I forget why I went to the beach in Connecticut, and even with whom I went.  But it was a weekend in college and I was excited to have a few hours away from campus.  And someone played John Coltrane on their boom box.  Compared to the hits of the time -- "Like a Virgin", "Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go" -- this felt positively urbane.  And my god was it irritating -- quacking, squawking, endless runs over unresolved chords -- it made an impression, and that impression was that if someone tells me they want to listen to Coltrane, I'll say "check please"...

Fast forward a few years, and I'm in my first year of graduate school.  The graduate dorm at Princeton was called the "Graduate College", and in the basement was a bar called "Debasement Bar."  They sold beer at cost and closed at 2AM, so I'd go pretty much every night around midnight, after I was done with my work for the day.  The group with whom I hung out was typical - two philosophy students, and English student and a latin student.  You'll note, no engineers or computer scientists -- they thought I was odd.  But one of the philosophers, and I'm sad that I don't remember his name, mentioned Coltrane, and I recounted how unpleasant I found his music.  He showed up the next day with two cassettes, and told me not to give another opinion until I had listened to them both a few times.  He was right -- I became a fan -- but I attribute a lot of that to the fact that the first song on the cassette was Naima.  It was everything that the prattle on the beach was not.  Of course, I then listened to as much Coltrane as I could, and it opened up a new world of music for me.  That said, I still find a lot of Coltrane irritating and even unlistenable, but I'll thank that nameless student, for taking the time for crafting a tape that got me into Coltrane, and for introducing me to "Naima".

Link #2: Cedar Walton was one of the pianists on Giant Steps, and he has recorded Naima multiple times -- this is a good one, and is notable as it is much more upbeat than the original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mF0hktO3YyA

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 (will have some Group C's in there).  2023-01-24
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023  2023-01-24

Music of the day -- as you may or may not know, I love music, so I'll include a "music of the day" in my post-class announcements.  I mostly like classical music, but have an affinity for rock and jazz as well.  Although my age means that you and I won't share the same exact musical loves, you may enjoy learning about some older music that you wouldn't learn about otherwise.  I'll start with a piece of music that's been going through my head for the past month (I wrote a little about it last semester): The piano piece "Toccatina" by Soviet composer Nikolai Kapustin.  Man, I can't shake it -- really rhythmic and percussive, and at two minutes, probably the right length.  When it's over, I listen again.  And again.  I have a theory that if I gave this 10 minutes a day for a year, I could play this, and man would it be fun.  But I probably won't have 10 minutes a day for another 10 years, and by that time I'll be so old that my digits won't go that fast.  Until then, it's just fantasy.

Here are some good performances.

I think Sukyeon Kim gives the best overall performance - good command of all the rythyms and percussiveness: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDufYI7aCFk

This one from "Cateen" is also good, and you can tell he loves playing the piece: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmcEQwvEw6g

This one from Shan-shan Sun has the best camera-work, and she seems pretty unhinged while nailing everything -- it's a good combination: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1VbN3Nlrxk

And finally, here is Yuja Wang playing the Toccatina as an encore -- her speed is phenomenal, but I do think you lose a lot by playing it so fast.  Regardless, it's a fun performance to watch and it's her encore, so she can do whatever she wants!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xZ-S6GynQc

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-02-09
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-02-09

Vronsky and Babin were a husband-wife piano duo from the 1930's to the 1960's.  My father always extolled their talents, but his records of them were these ancient 10" records and we never played them.  Regardless, I was listening to my random music from Naxos, and this two-piano arrangement of "Dance of the Tumblers" from composer Rimsky-Korsakov's ballet "The Snow Maiden" was simply too much fun.  Who did the arrangement?  Victor Babin, of Vronsky and Babin.  So I went to youtube, and check out this recording from 1945.  These two knew how to blister the piano: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nha5bms-yZs

Here they are taking care of another virtuoso duo piece by Rachmaninoff: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_x71v7MsD0

And finally one of my favorite piano duo pieces: "Scaramouche" by the French Composer, Darius Milhaud.  Milhaud was prolific, publishing over 400 works, and although I haven't listened to them all, I have listened to enough to know that only work worth listening to more than once is Scaramouche -- catchy, pensive, festive -- it's all there.  Milhaud is also interesting because he declared that unlike most "great" composers, he was not a miserable man, but he was quite happy.  Which is potentially why he wrote over 400 compositions, only one of which I'll listen two more than once...  Enjoy Scaramouche: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b94R1cTQGxQ - Scaramouche

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-02-14 Crash Burn
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-02-14

This one came on my random play today, just as I arrived in Min Kao, and I thought to myself -- is my face or my body language revealing how completely energetic and awesome this song is?  Talk about one that makes you want to air-harmonica, air-guitar, air-bass and air-drum simultaneously.  It's a tour de force: "Crash Burn" by Blues Traveler.  

Just two things to highlight.  First, although the harmonica and guitars are clearly the stars here, it would be nothing without the percussive interplay of the bass and drums.  Just pay attention to it (starting at 0:12).  Two, the middle section of the song has the performers doing rapid soloing -- harmonica, then guitar, then bass, then drums (starting 1:07).  Then harmonica, then guitar, then bass, then drums (starting 1:19).  Then harmonica (1:32), then guitar, which keeps playing through the bass, which keeps playing through the drums until -- whoooo! (1:44).  Man, that's good.

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-02-16 Falla's Danza Espanola
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-02-16

Falla - Danza Espanola from "La Vida Breve"

Around 1989, some promotional mailing reached me hawking a multi-LP set (yes, vinyl) of classical music entitled "Virtuoso," featuring recordings of virtuoso musicians from the early 1990's.  I bit, but convinced a few other grad students and staff to share the price ($60?  It was a lot at the time) and the albums.  That introduced me to Jashca Heifetz, a Russian-turned-American violinist who would be on anyone's short list of greatest violinists.  Later in life, I went on ebay and bought every Heifetz CD I could, and that introduced me to this piece by Spanish composer Manual de Falla.  It wasn't written for the violin, but a prominent violinist in the early 1900's, Fritz Kreisler, transcribed it for violin, and it has been a showpiece / encore piece for violinists ever since.  It's fun because it has that  lilting dance quality combined with some great intensity.  I especially like the part starting at 0:41 on the recording, where he's bouncing the bow off the strings, and alternating that with these choppy chords.  Give it a listen or two -- you'll be hooked: Heifetz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYr33VU3si8

Here's a video of Itzhak Perlman, playing it for Ronald Reagan back when he was president (1981-89 -- I had to look it up), and it's amazing how calm and effortless he is while ripping out those fast runs and chords (1:14).  Combined with the floppy-haired pianist, it's a good watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4ayc6Fb3hI

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-02-21 Genesis the Lamb:
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-02-21

As often is the case, today's MOTD comes from random-play as I walked into the office.  The song "Supernatural Anaesthesit", by the 1970's version of the band Genesis, came on, and it's a really pleasant listen -- mostly a nice Steve Hackett guitar solo over this slowly lilting rhythm.  Here you go:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GowZdTaKLL8&list=PLWnwFAnZO1AFdriGII5jQYpz-xkKv3u8m&index=15

The song is from their "concept" album, "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway", which, like Andrew Lloyd Webber's "Jesus Christ Superstar," and both "Tommy" and "Quadrophenia" by the Who, were Rock Operas.  These were soundtracks to a movie or musical that hadn't been produced.  The hope was that they would become popular enough for someone to produce them (which happened to the three I mentioned).  "The Lamb" was never produced -- probably too psychedelic in nature.  Whatever -- the album contained some great songs, but in my opinion, most of them were shoehorned to fit the narrative, so while the album was indeed successful, the individual songs were not so.  The only one to receive airplay was the opener, "The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hioAbdhfN_w&list=PLWnwFAnZO1AFdriGII5jQYpz-xkKv3u8m&index=1

The closing song, "It" is a joyous song, with an especially nice guitar/keyboard unison starting at 0:45.  It always makes me feel good, although it was never really successful, which I attribute to the lyrics being too cute for their own good, and who knows what an earth "It" is.  If you know or think you know, please don't tell me -- I'm happier in ignorance:

(BTW starting at track 21 makes for a better closing, but it's 10 minutes instead of 3).

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-02-21 Smooth fusion
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-02-21

Every now and then I'll get a "suggested MOTD" -- this one comes from CS202 student Will Buziak: Tropic Birds by Japanese guitarist Masayoshi Takanaka.  1970's smooth jazz fusion at its best -- good bass and excellent musicianship -- definitely one for the "getting your lab finished" playlist.  I find the beginning part a little tedious, so if you want to skip to the fusion, go to about 2:20.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59WMXkeJwvk

Continuing on the topic of 1970's "smooth" fusion to get you through that programming assignment or grant proposal -- here's "Siberian Workout" from guitarist George Benson: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ML6qGJVDWXM

The archtypical 1970's smooth fusion: "Morning Dance" by Spiro Gyra.  As with all of these, if you can get over the "Easy Listening" stigma, it's some great music that makes you feel good: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bVDZ5UY_oDw

And finally -- you can't do smooth fusion without Chuck Mangione's "Feels So Good".  Talk about lightning in a bottle.  Mangione was a pretty much no-name jazz musician who got a mainstream hit with the three-minute version of this song.  How and why did it become a hit?  No clue, but good for him for being able to cash in.  I can only imagine he had a killer agent.  He was also a character actor in "King of the Hill", but I digress.  Oh, and skip the first 1:30 if you find it tedious.

Group D: 360 Spring, 2023 2023-03-02 Elvis Costello
Group E: 202 Spring, 2023 2023-03-02 Elvis Costello

I was 11 years old in 1977, so staying up from 11:30 PM until 1:00 AM to watch Saturday Night Live (which started in 1975) seemed like one way of acting older than I was.  Never mind that I didn't understand half of the jokes.  I wouldn't let on.  SNL always had a guest musician, usually someone whom I knew, like the Rolling Stones, James Taylor and Blondie.  On this episode they had this odd dude with heavy glasses who showed nearly no emotion with his odd emotionless band.  It was Elvis Costello playing the song "Watching the Detectives," and although my first instinct was to dismiss this oddity, I did find the song oddly alluring.  Later on, in college, I bought the "Greatest Hits" of Elvis Costello, and as rewarded with a diverse set of songs, some of which were great, and some of which, well, just didn't do it for me.  "Pump It Up" came on my random-play recently, and that's a song that always makes me happy.  I also came to really like "Watching the Detectives" and its eery vibe (About a woman who has murdered but is getting away with it.  Something like that.)

Pump it up.  BTW, it's totally clear that they are not performing this on the video.  That detracts from the video, at least to me, but not the music! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Y71iDvCYXA 

Watching the Detectives: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1Qnt5bx1OI

Group D: 2023-03-28 ELP & Glinker
Group E: 2023-03-28 ELP & Glinker

(BTW, the opening paragraph is copied from spring, 2022.  The rest is new.)

The band Emerson, Lake and Palmer were a "power" trio in the 1970's: Keyboards, Guitar/Bass, Percussion, set in the time when synthesizers were for the nerdy, and record companies were willing to take fliers on 10+ minute songs.  Before I scare you off with one of those 10+ minute songs, , I'll include their three-minute album starter, the traditional British hymn, "Jerusalem", which gets me going every time I hear it!  It was banned by the BBC for airplay -- why?  Too good?  That's the only thing I can come up with: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9TbiIEpZJ8

I cite ELP though, because the song "The Endless Enigma" hit my random play yesterday, and it's worth sharing.  Yes, 10:41.  It begins with a *really* slow introduction of murkiness, piano/drum outbursts, weird synthesizer stuff.  The song gets going at the 1:39 mark with momentum driven by Keith Emerson's keyboard playing.  What I like about ELP is how energetic Emerson is, and how you can tell he really likes playing fast and rhythmically.  Almost too fast.  Almost.  But you can feel that he's having fun just by listening.  (You can tell that in Jerusalem as well).  It's great.  Of course, it devolves into "heady" lyrics, etc.  You can skip at that point.  You don't get anything as good as that 1:39 passage.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBYPae7sd3k

When I work, I listen to random classical music from Naxos, and interestingly, the Overture To Russlan and Ludmilla, by Russian composer Mikhail Glinka, came on.  This is the classical equivalent to Keith Emerson's keyboard playing -- when you get a good performance, it's fast.  Almost too fast. But man it's good.  I'm not sure if the performers are having a good time, but I hope they are.  I'll give a link to the ultimate in virtuoso orchestras -- the Leningrad Philharmonic when it was conducted by Yevgeny Mravinsky.  Man do they fly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMvOLepoBO8

You can see from the following link Yevgeny he doesn't look like he's having much fun.  Unfortunately they never really show the musicians, so you can skip this one after you see how stern the conductor is.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYuSdEEvke0 

Let's see an orchestra so you can see how fast those  musicians' hands are going -- I like this one: The Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev.  What I like this is that it shows that 90% of the time the orchestra doesn't need the conductor.  They're professionals.  And you can tell the conductor at least is having fun!!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLGTNqR4m-0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group D: 2023-03-28 - Tito Puente, Machito, Cal Tjader
Group E: 2023-03-28 - Tito Puente, Machito, Cal Tjader

On random play on my walk in today was the song "Serenata", by Cal Tjader, which is a really pleasant piece of Jazz -- lilting rhythms, upbeat chords -- it made for a happy walk into Min Kao.  Tjader became well known for "latin jazz", even though he was decidedly un-Latin (Swedish descent, born in St. Louis).  He was formally trained on timpani, but taught himself vibraphone, and that's what he played as a bandleader.  Not to many lead timpani players out there...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdQ4ES1Ad-Y

Also a vibraphonist, but also truly Latin was Tito Puente -- who has had a long reign of being the most famous Latin Jazz bandleader.  Here's a song that shows his band at their best -- the album closer "El Rey Del Timbal" (1984).  The first minute is pure energy heading into a drum interlude at 0:48.  The trumpets enter a 1:01, and what follows is simply a great 20 seconds of rhythmic playing by the whole band (the piano glissando at 1:13 is perfect.  Listen for it.  Perfect).  Frankly, the rest of the song doesn't keep up, but enjoy that first 1:20:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9d8p_7OU3k

If you liked that, then also listen to "Ran Kan Kan" from the same album.  This one is less frenetic, but holds you attention for the whole song -- like the "Ahhhhh!!" at 0:42.  It's like that glissando -- perfectly timed!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ko6gB-O_s3k

And while I'm on good 20 seconds of Latin Jazz, here's the best 20 seconds in my opinion.  Some back story though.  Machito was a bandleader in the 1940's, pioneering "Afro-Cuban" jazz.  Like the phrase "bacon double cheeseburger", Afro-Cuban jazz pretty much defines itself.  Anyway, these guys could play like they were on fire!  Sometime in the 40's or 50's, some music executives decided to pair Charlie Parker, one of the most famous Jazz saxophonists, with Machito on an album called "The Latin Bird" (Parker's nickname was the Yardbird).  The magnum opus was an 18 minute piece called "The Afro-Cuban Jazz Suite."  The juxtaposition of Parker and Machito is painfully horrible, so it's not worth listening to the whole thing, but there's a great passage starting at 4:52 (The link below starts you there).  It builds quickly to eight whole-band chords at 5:10.  Count em.  And that segues to piano and ... COW BELL!   WHOOOOOOO!  That's it though -- it devolves.  If you have the patience, listen to more of it -- the "Rumba Abierta" at 14:40 does a great fast&frenetic to slow and pensive.  Enjoy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qgF5Vd1mi4&t=291s

Group D: 2023-04-12 - Mahler
Group E: 2023-04-12 - Mahler

Today's MOTD comes to you care of CS202 student Zeke Engel, who said a few weeks ago, "today's music of the day reminded me of one my favorite symphonies, Mahler: Symphony No. 5 in C-Sharp Minor - IV. Adagietto.  It is a slow burn by all regards, but the finale is worth the 10 minute build up."  Good story about this movement:  (I'm making up some of the details here, but the arc of the story is correct): A Hollywood producer went to his music director's apartment, and the 4th movement of Gustav Mahler's 5th symphony was playing.  The producer listened for a bit, and said, "I don't care who this is -- sign this guy up to be our composer.  The next love scene will be a gold mine!"  The music director responded that it would be difficult, as Mahler had been dead for 50 years...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CFQQsu6VBYA

Mahler was a conductor by profession, and he pretty much wrote only symphonies and vocal music.  His symphonies are among the best of all time, but they are loooooooong.  I think only the 1st symphony clocks in under an hour.  Regardless, Mahler's 1st is among my 5 favorite symphonies, and I remember listening to it for the first time, on the advice of a friend in college.  You don't need to listen to all 45 minutes -- just listen to the first movement unfold: I had never heard anything like it at the time (my dad, a WWII vet, did not like German composers) -- organic, lush, wistful, beautiful, triumphant.  It's got it all.  To be honest, you kind of get diminishing returns listening to his remaining 8 symphonies.  After #1, I think his 6th is the best, followed by the 5th.

Group D: 2023-04-20 - Casiopea
Group E: 2023-04-20 - Casiopea

Today's MOTD comes from CS360 student Ryan Peruski -- It's interesting that two of the three guest-MOTD's this year have been for 1970's/19870's fusion bands from Japan.  These are fun listens, so thanks, Ryan!

I would like to introduce you all to one of my favorite bands, Casiopea (カシオペア)! This Tokyo-born jazz fusion band started in 1976 and had many popular albums throughout the late 1970's and 1980's. Furthermore, their music and this jazz fusion movement in the 1980's were credited as inspiration for Koji Kondo (the man who made the main Super Mario Bros theme and plenty more). As with this genre of music, known for its fast pace and solos on every instrument, you can expect nothing short of amazing when it comes to musicianship. This first track that I linked is called "ギャラクティックファンク” (Galactic Funk). I purposely linked a live version so that you can see how great their stage presence is, despite the complex parts they each play on their instruments. Notice the tight rhythm section, particularly the bass player (he is playing a technique known as "Slap Bass", giving the bass more flair and pop). The keyboardist during his solo also has the most contagious smile!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKgjOCuW_MU

The second link is the first song of their first (self-titled) album, "タイムリミット" (Time Limit). Another great fast-paced song, which perfectly describes its genre. I hope you enjoy the music that inspired more media than you may even realize!

Group E: 2023-04-27 - Cowboy Junkies

Today's MOTD comes to you from CS360 student Jiawei Chen -- Thanks, Jiawei!

Cowboy Junkies are an alternative country band from Canada. The classic album "The Trinity Session" was created under the influence of music heard during the tour in the southern United States. As the title of the album suggests, the album was recorded at Holy Trinity Church in Toronto. Because the album's producer, Peter Moore, suggested using the church's natural reverb instead of analog reverb hardware. To better convince church officials, the band said they were recording a Christmas special for the radio station. The entire recording process was recorded with only one microphone. In order to balance Margo's vocals with other instruments, she recorded through the PA system left by the previous team. By these means, the entire album was not mixed, dubbed, or edited in any way. The result is unlike any other country album (I've heard) from the 80s, or perhaps from the 90s either.

Group E: 2023-05-02 - Rachmaninoff Moments Musicaux

Let's channel a mood.  Your head was exploding yesterday, and when you went to bed, your temperature was over 100 degress, prompting your wife to make you sleep in the guest room.  When you awaken, you decide to teach class over Zoom so as not to infect anyone.  When you don your headphones and hunker down to your laptop, feeling like shit on a stick, there's only one thing to listen to -- Rachmaninoff's Moments Musicaux.

I recommended the first of this set last thursday with the following quote: "Back in the days before random-play, I had all my music on cassette tapes, and I knew when I pulled this out that I was likely in a wistful, maybe even down mood."  Well, this morning before class, I was in this mood, and there's no more perfect music.  All six pieces.  I'm not going to say that they capture how I feel, but they sure do augment it.  Keep this link around -- you're going to wake up some morning either knowing or not knowing why all is not right with your world, but you'll find this music oddly comforting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu2tVsriEhI

Group D: 2023-05-04 - Greyboy Allstars, Fred Wesley
Group E: 2023-05-04 - Greyboy Allstars, Fred Wesley

This is from CS360 student Finli Hill -- I'm going include his prose here, and then my prose and comments after that.

From Finli:

Imagine this: You're in month 3 of James Plank's infamous 360 class, the ultimate trial by fire in the UTK CS curriculum. You're writing Jshell, and if the year was 1987, you'd have been expelled by now for forkbombing 20 times. You've been staring at the pipe lecture notes for so long that when you look away from the screen, you see the text on the walls. You should have started earlier. Not even ChatGPT can save you now...

But there's a light in the smelly darkness (you haven't showered) - the sweet sound of The Greyboy Allstars: a 1994 U.S. jazz-funk band with five members, fun shows, and popular albums. If only you could play the saxophone like Karl Denson, you wouldn't have to endure this lab. But alas, you can't, because he plays like Dr. Plank codes - pure poetry in motion.

When 360 gets hard, take breaks to listen to The Greyboy Allstars. Their music will give you the strength to keep going. 

Here are two of my favorites:
Soul Dream (1994) -- This one has some really nice brass in it, which I'm partial to:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8naZ82JUj-4&list=OLAK5uy_lAIw9uRMbzt9B2swtUKt7H9bEB-E6A7N4

Toys R Us (1997) -- has some good keys in it:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfLXcGVIjNw

From Dr. Plank:

What a great find -- those are great songs, thanks!  I especially like "Toys R Us" -- great rhythms and bass!

Interestingly, the first song is from the album "West Coast Boogaloo", by The Greyboy Allstars with Fred Wesley.  If you don't know, Fred Wesley is the reason why my variable names and program inputs are always "Fred"!  Wesley was the trombone player in James Brown's backing band, "The JB's".  The band released its own records, often with James Brown playing keyboards and sometimes with him singing/bandleading.  One of those releases was the song "Doing It To Death", by "Fred Wesley and the JB's", but it's completely led by James Brown.  James' introduction to Fred's solo is a total classic -- "FRED!" "FRED!" -- The link takes you directly there, but the song is worth listening to in its entirety so you get Maceo Parker's solo, and James' giant build-up to to a truly unexciting chord change to "D".

Group D: 2023-05-09 - The Meters
Group E: 2023-05-09 - The Meters

Quick MOTD today -- Pungee, by the Meters.  I've always considered the Meters to be like the "Handbook" of funk.  Their songs are short, focused, tight and brilliant.  Each song is like a perfect funk snippet.  With Pungee, you can listen to every instrument on its own -- bass, drums, organ, guitar -- each is doing its own thing impeccably, but when you combine them, the whole -- the sum of the parts -- is irresistible.  I've enjoyed sharing music with you this semester, and I've enjoyed that y'all have shared with me!

Today's MOTD is a guest MOTD sent by student Will Buziak at the end of last semester.  Thank you, WIll!  (I'll say that at the moment, I'm not a fan, but you never know.)

M.O.T.D: Summer Heat Edition - The Band: Electric Citizen

A new-ish rendition of classic themes and a band that I have enjoyed discovering lately. In my opinion, the fast-paced electric guitar riffs resonate with the lead's vocals in a manner that is indicative of their name. I hope you enjoy enough to venture yourself through the discography of "electric citizen", but I suggest beginning with "Beggar's Need":
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KbU2OATNZFE

My personal favorite is "Light years beyond", but I can see it, as well as the rest of their music, as too similar to bands that have come before. Nevertheless, it gives legendary undertones to my otherwise unremarkable 5 minute drive to min kao in my VW Jetta. Also from the album "Sateen", which I recommend, as I think it is currently their strongest album (I believe there is one coming around the corner).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4q2H-sEF38g

If you enjoy those, I also recommend "Heart Attack" from the album "HeIItown". This song is definitely more in your face, but if you have caught on with their sound, it is another great addition to the chaotic display of the average American's driving ability in the deadly arena of rush hour traffic.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group E: 2023-08-31 Pay Attention to the Organ

Today's MOTD features three songs with something in common -- give them a listen (if you don't know them already) and see if you can spot the commonality:

Born to Be Wild by Steppenwolf in 1968: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igvP806798U
Fly Like an Eagle by Steve Miller in 1976: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuXwSyahgW4
Old Enough by The Raconteurs in 2009: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXfpre4w540

So what do they have in common, besides the fact that they are all great songs, in my opinion?  The answer is the Organ!  Ok, maybe by 1976 or 2009 they are really just synthesizers, but they are definitely in organ mode.  In each song, the organ is subtle -- you might not even notice it if it weren't pointed out to you.  It's not the song's first highlight or second highlight, but the organ punches it up significantly.  Now go back and listen to the three songs and pay attention to the organ.  It's essential!  Want more evidence?  Listen to the myopic version of Old Enough with Ricky Skaggs and Ashley Monroe that doesn't have an organ.  Lame.  What's missing -- THE ORGAN!!!! 

That version is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qahZ-whM6o

------------------------------------------------------------
Group E: 2023-09-28 Stephen Stills

Another good random play moment -- The song "Bound to Fall", by Stephen Still's band, "Manassas" in 1972.  I bought the CD for cheap, probably from McKays 25 years ago, put all of the songs into my music library and never thought about it again.  But then this song came on in my car when I had a 30-minute drive in front of me, and it consumed all 30 minutes.  Give it a quick listen -- those are pretty tricky rhythms, aren't they?  Catchy too, although not catchy enough to make any money.  It took me a while to figure out the rhythmic pattern: 7 - 8 - 7 - 7 / 7 - 8 - 8 / Then a bunch of 3's.  That's pretty cool! 
ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kSVXVOr0uQ 

Stephen Stills was the "Stills" in "Crosby, Stills and Nash" (and sometimes "and Young"), and he wrote the most iconic songs for that group.  I never know what you know about music of that era, even music that was super-famous in that era, so I'll explain: David Crosby, Stephen Stills, Graham Nash and Neil Young were singer/guitarists for other groups, who got together and caught lightning in a bottle.  Each of them had skill as a songwriter, and I think that when each contributed 3 songs on an album, it made for a far stronger album than having one of them contribute all 12 songs.  Regardless, the songs by Stills are the ones that you typically associate with the "sound" of Crosby, Stills & Nash.  For example, "Suite: Judy Blue Eyes", is about as iconic as you get:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGT0P0XJRFM

Two more Stills songs are worth mentioning -- first, "Love the One You're With", which is as iconic as "Judy Blue Eyes", but it was a solo effort from Stills:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HH3ruuml-R4

Second is "Rock & Roll Woman" from his time in the group "Buffalo Springfield", which is my personal favorite, because it's got a great mood and really inventive melody.  It usually gets a second listen when it appears on my random-play.  Video from the "Flip Wilson" show:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Eh4Ml6xY-0

------------------------------------------------------------
Group E: 2023-10-03 Alicia de Larrocha

Now that I think about it, I have no idea how Dad heard about Alicia de Larrocha.  He loved classical piano, but none of his friends or colleagues did.  So how did he get his information, back in the 1970's, before there were personal computers, let alone the Internet?  It's an enigma.  I suspect he frequented a classical record store, or maybe subscribed to a magazine or newsletter.  I don't know, and he's no longer around to query, so it will remain an enigma.  But somehow Dad heard about de Larrocha, and bought an LP entitled "Alicia De Larrocha Plays Spanish Piano Music of the 20th Century".  I'm so glad that he did.  This LP featured music from unknown Spanish composers Ernesto Halffter, Carlos Surinach, Federico Mompou, Joaquin Nin-Culmell and Xavier Montsalvatge, and every piece of music is great.  Great!  So, I'll put some links here, and there are two things that I'd like you to get from this.  First, the music is so good -- these composers aren't Beethoven, Mozart or Bach, but their music is emotional, direct, and effective.  Start with the Danza de la Pastora -- holy shit that's five minutes of music that's just irrestitible.  Ditto those Mompou songs and dances -- they hit you in places you didn't know existed.

Second, Ms. de Larrocha is so talented and forthright in how she plays.  Damn.  There is not a millisecond where she is not in complete control of the piano.  I saw her twice in the 1970's/1980's -- once in Philadelphia, and then once in Wilmington, Delaware (where I'm from) -- and I have to say thank you to my father who took me to those two concerts.  It's not often that you see someone who is so accomplished at their craft, so if you have the time, check out the two videos where you can see her playing.  It's inspiring to see someone that talented and that confident.  Enjoy.

#1 has a pretty tedious introduction, but then you see her playing Halffter's Danza de la Pastora, which is 100% worth watching - such confidence and skill: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PU_UnEM-ZV8

Here's Danza de la Pastora from the album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giN-Hpm4GxA

Danza de la Gitana - remember, all of these songs were completely unknown when she made the album: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrV70LlSBIk

The songs of Carlos Surinach: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiIlEkXZxd4

A concert from 1970, with Mompou and Montsalvatge.  It's unfortunate that the concert starts with a pretty dull sonata from the composer Soler, so skip it.  The rest is good stuff, and the Montsalvatge Sonatina is really inventive music (it was Dad's favorite on the album, and I don't blame him).  And again, Ms. de Larrocha is a rock-crusher - so check it out! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUSvYrG_B5Q

------------------------------------------------------------
Group E: 2023-10-05 Stevie Wonder

Today's MOTD features a song that simply makes me happy when I hear it.  All 15 minutes of it!  It's the "long" version of the song "Do I Do" by Stevie Wonder, from 1981.  As always, I have no idea what any of you think about Stevie Wonder, if you think of him it all.  A supremely talented singer, songwriter, harmonica-player and music producer -- Stevie did it all.  And he was blind pretty much from birth.  When I was in college, I bought "The Original Musiquarium" double CD of Stevie's greatest hits, largely because I felt I didn't know enough about Stevie -- after listening to that one over and over, I got to know and love Stevie.  So if you like this, look for other songs from the album -- "Superstition", "Master Blaster", "That Girl", "I Wish" -- they're all great.  This extended take of "Do I Do" ends the album and I find it upbeat and infectious.  There are some odd moments -- he has jazz great Dizzy Gillespie play a trumpet solo, and I don't know if Dizzy was drunk, high, depressed -- whatever, but the solo is way too understated for the song, and comes off pretty lame.  Of course, Stevie then plays Dizzy's exact solo on harmonica and absolutely slays it.  Maybe that was the point?  Who knows.  The ending's a little odd too, but to me that just adds to the fact that Stevie took some risks and accepted the results.

And it's not like Dizzy couldn't simply wail on the trumpet -- check out his intro and solos on "Manteca Suite" from 1948 -- cranking it up to 11 at all times:

Group E: 2023-11-14 Oakland Stroke

I don't have time to write much today, but this song has been on my mind today.  If you have been an any of my classes that you know I love Tower of Power -- this is the song that the use to open and close their album "Back to Oakland".  Definitely a microcosm for Tower of Power -- tight horns, great drums, plus a busy and funky bass.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xS4CRaCP0uw

Group E: 2023-11-16 Annie Fischer

I'll give credit to youtube's recommendation algorithms today.  I was randomly listening to music the other night, when youtube suggested this link of a pianist named Annie Fischer playing my favorite Beethoven piano piece, the "Appassionata".  I had never heard of her.  Holy crap.  Ms. Fischer was born in Hungary in 1910, and died in Hungary in 1995.  She wasn't well known outside of Europe, but fortunately, these days we have youtube.  She curated performances of all 32 of Beethoven's sonatas, and arranged them to be released when she died.  Morbid?  I don't know.  I haven't listened to all of them, yet.  But she performs Beethoven, well any composer, in my favorite manner -- direct, emotional, no bullshit.  It's hard.  You have to figure out how the music makes you feel, and then you deliver the music and that feeling all at the same time.  The great pianists do that -- Sviatoslav Richter, Alfred Cortot, Emil Gilels, Robert Casadesus -- and Annie Fischer.  I'm going to enjoy exploring all 32 of Beethoven's sonatas.  But I'll recommend her performance of the Apassionata to you --

Group E: 2023-11-21 Villa-Lobos

Heitor Villa-Lobos is a man with an incredible story.  He was born in 1887 in Brazil, and was an exceptionally prolific composer.  He composed over 2000 works in all genres, but he would likely have languished in obscurity were it not for a few well-known musicians of the time traveling to Brazil who got acquainted with his music, and felt the need to promote it.  The two most important musicians were pianist Artur Rubinstein, and guitarist Andre Segovia.  Rubinstein regularly featured Villa-Lobos' set of 9 small piano pieces called "A Prole do Bebe", or "The Baby's Family".  Each piece features a different doll, and the pieces are, both as a whole, and individually, captivating.  Being me, I've listened to a ton of Villa-Lobos' compositions, and for the most part, I can take or leave them, but there are exceptions, starting with A Prole do Bebe, each piece of which is simply a stroke of inspiration.  I worked diligently to play the first one, "Branquinha" when I was in high school.  My dad loved "O Polichinelle", and although it is a great piece, it didn't wear well listening to him playing it night after night after night (dad was a very skilled pianist, far better than I).  My other favorite from the set was "Bruxa - the witch doll", which I also worked on diligently -- like dad's Polichinelle, it was likely far more fun for me to play than for anyone in my family to listen to me playing over and over and over...  You get the picture.  Recommendations:

The Brazilian pianist Nelson Friere has the best interpretation of "A prole do bebe" to me.  Here you can see him play Branquinha far better than I ever could: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0f6nEMvII6A

Marc-Andre Hamelin is an incredibly talented pianist from a technical perspective.  Here he plays "Bruxa": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3Vp4SMeX5s

Here's Artur Rubinstein, the man who put Villa-Lobos on the map, playing dad's favorite "Polichinelle".  Dad took me to see Rubinstein in the 70's, when I was about 10 years old, and I remember Rubinstein playing four encores, one of which was, of course "Polichinelle": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbhIiXDa2bk

And last -- Cristina Ortiz plays the Introductory movement from "Bachianas Brasileiras" #4 -- this is a very direct and emotional piece of music which, unlike "A Prole do Bebe", is more in the European style than anything Brazilian.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auXtCoL__1U

Group E: 2023-11-28 Steve Howe - The Clap

The good thing about youtube's AI is that it doesn't try to reason why I like the things I like.  Instead, it just feeds them into its neural networks and then predicts what I'm going to like next.  It recently decided that I'd like to see Steve Howe play his guitar composition called "The Clap", from the 1970 album "The Yes Album" by the progressive rock group, "Yes."  It was right.  Steve Howe is an incredible guitarist, and watching him play "The Clap" over the years simply attests to that fact.  What strikes me is how precise he is, how spindly his fingers are, and how much he uses his pinky.  Even at 75 years old.  Makes me wonder if he did exercises to strengthen it, because if you've tried to use the pinky as Howe does, either on the guitar or on the piano, you'll be impressed.  Yes, the same song four times over 50 years, and although his energy in 2022 is not quite what it was in 1972, the talent is still there.  Thanks, youtube.

1972 -- 25 years old.  He's looking a little manic, don't you think?  Incredible talent, though.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNUedapF-bo

1988 -- 31 years old.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTXtwTJUBRs

2015 -- although he looks a little like the ghost of Christmas future, he's only 68 here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qwGb7wuqUFs

2022 - 50 years after the original.  Gives me some hope that maybe when I'm 75, I'll still be able to write Dijkstra's algorithm live in class... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emFrWFTZfVg

Group E: 2023-12-05 The "What?" Moment

As I was walking yesterday, the song "You Keep Me Hangin' On" came on my random play.  This song
was a number one hit for the Supremes in 1966, and again for Kim Wilde in 1987, but neither of
those is the version that came on -- instead it was Wilson Pickett's, from 1969. This song's intro
always gets me -- Listen to the first 30 seconds, and pay attention.  The first 10 seconds are
completely normal -- a slow, dramatic intro.  When the next 10 seconds start, you think it's going
to be a repeat, but pay attention to the bass, especially at the 16/17 second mark.  What????
Listen again.  What???  It's incredible.  I think musically all of the other instruments are
playing the dominant chord, while the bass roots it on the tonic.  But I could be wrong -- it's not
like I'm a music professor.  Oh man.  The rest of the song is great too -- by far my favorite
version, but to be fair, I also have a soft spot for the Kim Wilde version, since I was in college.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iacBICze80M

It got me thinking about music that makes me stop and go "What???" like that Wilson Pickett chord.
We'll call Wilson Picket #1. #2 is "Pusherman" by Curtis Mayfield, from the soundtrack to the movie
"Superfly." The whole soundtrack is fantastic, with all of the songs being pretty emotionally
rough, but beautifully written and performed.  In the movie, "Pusherman" is the background to a
montage showing cocaine going from import to distribution, but it's a really inventive song.  The
"What???" moment for me is again at 17 seconds.  Where does that chord come from?  It's the
backbone of the song, though, always coming on beat 2 and coinciding with the highest note on the
bass line.  I can't say enough good things about how creative Mayfield was writing this song.  The
lyrics are intentionally gritty, BTW. It's not like any of us are singing this song in the
shower... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xatZALKiI8A

#3: "I Feel Free" by Cream.  Let me quote from my MOTD in 2021: The serendipity of random-play and
    random-stream gives you good songs and bad songs, but the good ones feel extra refreshing.  On
    the walk in from Fort Sanders today, I was treated to "I Feel Free", by Cream, the first "super
    trio" of Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker.  1967 maybe.  For being 50+ years old, this
    song stands the test of time -- it's under three minutes, so it won't take two much of your
    time to listen, and let me highlight a few things.  First, is the moment at 0:29, when the
    drums, which have just been understatedly tapping on the offbeat, have a tiny solo and switch
    the rhythm to being on the beat -- great (What???).  Second is Eric Clapton's guitar solo whose
    first note (1:15) hits you like an AC current, and keeps your fingers in the socket until he
    starts wailing at 1:41 (What???).  Third, I think one of the things that makes this song so
    effective is the combination of the spacy (and meaning less) lyrics and trippy melodic line,
    with the relentlessly forward driving bass and drums.  I can be in a crappy mood, and this song
    always gives me a good jolt!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prnbF8Eagdg

#4: Switching to classical.  I grew up with a father who thought Russian composer Sergei
    Prokofiev's 7th piano sonata was the best piece of music ever written.  I was young - I never
    doubted him, and it wasn't until I went to college that I realized that no one, not even people
    who liked classical music, had ever heard of it.  Thanks dad.  On the flip side, I did teach my
    daughters that XOR was the most important arithmetic operation and that in a Galois Field,
    1+1=0. We do these things to our children.  Regardless, it will be hard to communicate the
    "What???" moment of Prokofiev's 7th, because it is discordant and violent in general, but
    there's no harm in trying.  Listen to the first 35 seconds -- yes, it's chaotic and violent,
    but there are some themes and some drive to it.  Pay attention to the passage from 0:18 to
    0:33. Maybe listen once or twice.  That's a focal point.  This movement has well demarcated
    sections.  The first aggressive section ends at 1:30, and then things get
    pensive. At 3:10, things start getting more dramtic and at 3:28, we're in full swing again.  He
         wrote this during World War II, by the way.  In Russia.  We're getting to the "What??"
         moment.  At 3:41, we've built to the same theme passage as 0:18, but what follows, at
         3:45, is sheer cacaphony.  What???  I don't understand it.  I don't think I'll ever
         understand it.  But it continues with drive and direction to 3:51, at which point you can
         understand things again.  It may be my favorite moment in music simply because I don't
         understand it, but it moves me dramatically.  You may need to give it a few repetitions to
         understand.  Interestingly, the last few bars of this sonata are similar -- start at 16:22
         -- the theme is far more accessible.  Right at 17:15 the music goes completely unhinged
         until the end.  What??  ? I've played it and I don't understand what's going on, but man
         is it good.  The performance here is by Soviet pianist Sviatoslav Richter, who premiered
         the sonata.  He record ed it many times, but this one is two the three levels more savage
         than the others.  Maybe he had some bad borscht before hand?

Group E: 2024-01-23: Rachmaninoff's 1st Sonata, 3rd movement

For those of you haven't had me before, I like to include a "Music of the Day" at the end of each announcement.  I love classical music, especially classical piano, so that makes up a lot of my MOTD postings, and you may find the music worth a click to discover something new.  I also like jazz and rock, although my age means that I'll likely like something slightly older than what you like.  However, again, you may discover something good by clicking on the links.

Today's link is a piece that I stumbled on randomly using UT's Naxos Music Library, and although I've heard it many times, I never paid attention -- it was background music to me working.  It's worth paying attention to, I think.  It's the last movement of Rachmaninoff's 1st piano sonata.  Rachmaninoff wrote two sonats, and the 1st is almost completely neglected.  It wasn't popular when Rachmaninoff wrote it, I'm guessing because it is dense -- you aren't going to sing along to this one. The main figure starting at 0:03 is complex rhythmically -- the left hand plays with 12 beats to the measure, while the right hand plays with 8 beats to the measure.  On top of each other.  You can't really hear the rhythms, I don't think, but I'm sure that's what underpins the extremely restless nature of the music.  I really like it, and it gets better with repetition.  Valentina Lisitsa's video her shows some astounding playing.  Check out the part starting at 4:08, where her right has has to play the notes at both the top and bottom, crossing over the left to do so.  It's a beautiful atmosphere.

Random trivia -- Rachmaninoff gave his last concert in Alumni Gym in Knoxville.  You can see a statue commemorating him in the World's Fair Park, just caddy-corner to Min Kao.

------------------------------------------------------------
Group E: 2024-02-01: Eden and Tamir

I woke up today with this tune in my head -- the third movement of Francois Poulenc's 1st sonata for two pianos:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nq5y8Y3IIME

I find something irresistable about the harmonies starting at the 10 second mark, and also at 0:40.  It's a short piece so give it a try.

Eden and Tamir in the 1960's were the classical world's foremost piano duo.  Interesting, beause evidently Ms. Eden didn't like the camera or the microphone, so she wasn't mush a self-promoter.  I believe Mr. Tamir may have held that capacity.  Regardless, their performances have a lot of life, which is difficult when you have two people whose first goal is to play together, and not necessarily be lively.  The link below has all of the tracks from Eden and Tamir's complete recordings.  If you want to do a deeper dive, try the Rachmaninoff, Lutislawski and the Brahms.

Francis Poulenc was a French composer who published from the 1920's.  He was part of a group of six young French composers who called themselves "Les Six."  One thing that they all have in common it that I like almost none of their music.  And really, none of them became famous composers -- kind of a the B league from France.

There are exceptions.  One of "Les Six," Darius Milhaud, wrote a two-piano set of three pieces called "Scaramouche," which just makes me feel good when I hear it.  It also makes me wish that these composers from "Les Six" would have written more music like this.  Here is Scaramouche, from Eden and Tamir:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=spNQGr6P3OU&list=OLAK5uy_kSAr_U2NcdGslsIfPrbJtNaKyU7mJr2jM&index=5

Another notable exception is Poulenc's set of three "Perpetual Motions" for piano.  If you're a movie buff, you'll note that this piece is featured throughout Alfred Hitchcock's psychological murder movie, "Rope", employed to illustrate one of the protagonist's unrest at having committed a murder.  Here's Arthur Rubinstein playing the set -- they do have a great mood to them, and they are not to hard to play:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJUY5CZEBZo

And another exception is Poulenc's captivating flute sonata played here in a video by Jean-Pierre Rampal and Robert Veyron Lacroix.  I'm telling you, the potential is there -- Poulenc wrote some fantastic music, but listen to something random by Poulenc or the rest of "Les Six", and you'll quickly be clicking on something else.  So it goes...
